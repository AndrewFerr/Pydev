<h3>'Quick Install':</h3>

<p><strong>Update Manager</strong> </p>

<p> Go to the update manager (help > Software Updates > Find and Install > Search for new feature to install),
	add: <A href="http://www.fabioz.com/pydev/updates/">http://www.fabioz.com/pydev/updates/</A> (or another of the specified urls) 
	as a 'remote site' and let Eclipse 'finish' it for you.</p>
<br/>
<p><strong>Zip file</strong></p>

<p>After downloading the zip file, you have to extract it 
yourself on top of Eclipse. If you choose to do it, just make sure the plugins folder 
is extracted on top of the Eclipse plugins folder. After that, restart it with the '-clean' flag, to
make sure Eclipse finds out about it.</p>
