<h2>Launching/Debugging Python scripts</h2>

The easiest way of launching a python file from pydev is having it open and using the F9 keybinding. Through that command,
Pydev will create/reuse a launch config to run the current editor based on the current settings of the project (i.e.:
if the project is configured as iron python, it'll use an iron python interpreter).



<p>Here it is, try it out. You have: </p>
<ul>
  <li>breakpoints (with optional condition)</li>
  <li>step in/out/over</li>
  <li>multiple threads stack view</li>
  <li>variable display</li>
</ul>

<p>The debugger can be invoked from the standard Eclipse debugger menus in the debug perspective, or through a context menu inside  Navigator:</p>
<p><p><img border="1" src="images/debugger/debug_menu.png" ></p>

<p>Debug settings are configured in the standard dialog </p>

<p>Here you can pick your program arguments, etc. The dialog will try to verify that your python interpreter is present. If it is not, go to Preferences:Pydev:Debug and configure a valid python executable.</p>

<p>The program output is displayed in the console, and the errors in the console are hyperlinked back to the file:</p>

<p>If you are running under the debugger, you'll get the standard debug interface:</p>
