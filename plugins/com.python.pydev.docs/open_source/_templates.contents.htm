<p>
Templates is a sort of code completion that allows you to 
create a template and use it after when you're editing code.
</p>

<p>
Let's see an example. 
</p>

<p>
First, you have to create the template in the pydev preferences page, let's say 
you want to add a token "pd" with "import pdb; pdb.set_trace()".
</p>

<p>
After doing it, you can use it in the editor by typing "pd" and Ctrl+Space (it is the same
keybing used for code completion, so, it may bring code completion suggestions too).
</p>

<p>
The example below shows what I mean.
