<h3>My project is correctly configured, why are my tasks still not appearing?</h3>
<p>
The tasks are based on the builder, so, if you don't use the autobuild, you have to 
make the manual build (Ctrl+B) once in a while to get the tasks updated (in fact, the auto-build affects 
lots of things, such as code-completion, code analysis, etc, so, you're reccommended to keep it on)<br/>
