<p>Ok, now that your interpreter is configured, it is time to <strong>create a project</strong>.</p>
<p>After opening Eclipse, go to the menu:
<strong>file &gt; new &gt; project &gt; Pydev &gt; Pydev project</strong>. You should see the screen below:</p>
<img alt="images/new_project.png" class="snap align-center" src="images/new_project.png" />
<p><strong>Project name</strong>: this is the name of the project.</p>
<p><strong>Project contents</strong>: where it should be located.</p>
<p><strong>Project type</strong>: defines the set of interpreters that will be available for that project.</p>
<p><strong>Grammar version</strong>: the grammar used for parsing the files in this project. It doesn't have to match the grammar of the
actual interpreter selected. This is done so that you can use a newer interpreter while having the grammar you use
compatible with an older interpreter (e.g.: using a Python 2.6 interpreter with a Python 2.4 grammar in the project).</p>
<p><strong>Interpreter</strong>: Defines which interpreter should be used for code-completion and default run configurations (note that
you can still create a run configuration with a different interpreter).</p>
<p><strong>Create default 'src' folder and add it to the pythonpath</strong>: If you don't leave that option checked, you'll have to create
the source folder(s) yourself after the project is created (which is covered in the next tutorial page).</p>
<p>You may finish in this screen or go to the next, where you will be asked which projects are referenced from this one.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="referenced-projects">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2">Referenced projects</a></h1>
<p>The referenced projects are the projects whose source folders are added to the PYTHONPATH for the
referrer project.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="manual_101_project_conf2.html">next tutorial page</a> enters into more details on project references</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="creating-a-project-from-existing-sources">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">Creating a Project from existing sources</a></h1>
<blockquote>
<p>If you <strong>created the project inside Eclipse</strong>, you just have to import the project again
(in <strong>files &gt; import &gt; general &gt; existing projects into workspace</strong>) -- it'll look for the existing .project
file and will configure it automatically from the existing configuration.</p>
<p>If you have the sources from an existing project that wasn't created in Eclipse, you have 2 options:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Create the project as if it was a new project, but leave the <strong>create default 'src' folder</strong> option
<strong>unchecked</strong> and point the location to the location of the sources (or a level above) -- the next tutorial page
will explain the steps to configure the PYTHONPATH (which should be done after creating the project this way).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Create a new project in the default workspace and create a folder that's a <strong>link to your existing sources</strong>. Note
that this link folder must be added to the PYTHONPATH in the next step.</p>
<p><strong>Note 1</strong>: <strong>links</strong> can be used <strong>above the source folder</strong> or <strong>as the source folder</strong>, but
<strong>never inside a source folder</strong>, as it's not supported by Pydev)</p>
<p><strong>Note 2</strong>: To create the folder as a link, choose the <strong>file &gt; new &gt; folder</strong> from the menu and in the new folder
dialog select the <strong>Advanced &gt;&gt;</strong> options.</p>
<p><strong>Note 3</strong>: If the file structure you have is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>myproject</p>
<blockquote>
<p>__init__.py</p>
<p>module.py</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and you want to make the import:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>from myproject import module</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>you have to add to the project the <strong>folder above myproject</strong> (as the folder above myproject
will be your source folder -- as required by Python).</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
