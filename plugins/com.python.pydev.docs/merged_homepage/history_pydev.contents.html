<li><p class="first">Code generation for classes and methods:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that this is an initial implementation of the idea, aimed as those that use a TDD (Test Driven Development) approach,
so, one can create the test first and generate the classes/methods later on from using shortcuts or quick-fixes (which is
something that those using JDT -- Java Development Tools -- in Eclipse should be already familiar with). This feature
should be already usable on a number of situations but it's still far from being 100% complete.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Alt+Shift+S C can be used to create a class for the currently selected token</li>
<li>Alt+Shift+S M can be used to create a method for the currently selected token</li>

<strong>note:</strong> it prevented the debugger from working correctly with Jython).</li>
<li><strong>Project build</strong>: Only referenced projects are rebuilt (and not all projects in the workspace -- e.g.: unreferenced c++ projects).</li>
<li><strong>Spell checking (depends on JDT)</strong>: Integrated for comments and strings within PyDev (eclipse 3.4 should add the 
support for working without JDT. Reference: <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/platform-text/3.4/plan.php">
http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/platform-text/3.4/plan.php</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Files without extension</strong>: A file without extension can have code-completion / go to definition (as long as the others around it do have extensions)</li>
<li><strong>Debug</strong>: Variable substitution is no longer asked twice in debug mode.</li>
<li><strong>Custom Filters</strong>: User-defined filters can be specified in the <strong>PyDev package explorer</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Debugger</strong>: performance improvements to get the existing frames for Python 2.4 and Jython 2.1.</li>
<li><strong>Outline view</strong>: Better refresh (doesn't collapse the tree for simple structure changes).</li>
<li><strong>Undo limit</strong>: The undo limit set in window > preferences > general > editors > text editors works for PyDev.</li>
<li><strong>Editor: Tabs as spaces</strong>: The newly added 'insert spaces for tabs' in the general preferences was conflicting with PyDev (those settings are now ignored)</li>
<li><strong>Patch by Laurent Dore</strong>: Added filter for *.py~ and comments</li>
<li><strong>Delete *.pyc action</strong>: also deletes *.pyo files</li>
<li><strong>Ctrl+Click</strong>: behaves exactly as F3.</li>
<li><strong>Dedent</strong>: No auto-dedent after yield</li>
</ul>
