		Well, let's see how refactoring works... and let's make it by example :-P
	</p>

		
	<p>
		As our 'base', we will use the example below:
	</p>
	<p align="center"><IMG src="images/refactor/refactor_base.png" border="1"/></p><br/>


	<p>
		<strong>Renaming</strong>: This refactoring is provided by Pydev Extensions and provides a 
		<strong>preview</strong> and <strong>undo/redo</strong> (the others are provided by BRM and have undo/redo only for the current editor
		-- which should be ok as they are refactorings that work only in the local scope).<br/>

		<ul>
			<li>Features: </li>		
			<ul>
				<li>Keybinding: <strong>Alt+Shift+R</strong></li>
				<li>Supports <strong>preview</strong></li>
				<li>Integrated in the editor (but not in the package explorer, so, it can rename a module, but only through an import to that module)</li>
				<li>Supports <strong>undo/redo</strong> in the workspace</li>
				<li>Rename class</li>
				<li>Rename method</li>
				<li>Rename attribute</li>
				<li>Rename imports</li>
				<li>Rename local variable</li>
			</ul>	
		</ul>	
		Let's say we want to rename our 'newVar', and call it 'renamedVar'. To do that, mark it and press <strong>Alt+Shift+R</strong>
		and set the name to 'renamedVar'
	</p>
	<br/><p align="center"><IMG src="images/refactor/refactor_rename1.png" border="1"/></p><br/>

	
	<p>
		That would give us the following result:
	</p>
	<br/><p align="center"><IMG src="images/refactor/refactor_rename2.png" border="1"/></p><br/>
	<hr/>

	
	
	<p>
		<strong>Extracting a method</strong>: Let's mark the '100+500' and press <strong>Alt+Shift+M</strong> (alternatively,
		you could use a context menu: press the right button and select: refactoring > Extract Method). And set the name of the
		new method to 'newMethod'.
	</p>
	<br/><p align="center"><IMG src="images/refactor/refactor_extract_method1.png" border="1"/></p><br/>

	
	<p>
		That would give us the following result:
	</p>
	<br/><p align="center"><IMG src="images/refactor/refactor_extract_method2.png" border="1"/></p><br/>

	<hr/>
	<p>
		<strong>Inlining a variable</strong>: Let's say that we are still not satisfied with that, we wouldn't like that 'var'
		variable, so, we want to remove the reference to it and call the method directly. To do that, mark the 'var' and press
		<strong>Alt+Shift+I</strong>.
	</p>
	<br/><p align="center"><IMG src="images/refactor/refactor_inline1.png" border="1"/></p><br/>

	
	<p>
		That would give us the following result:
	</p>
	<br/><p align="center"><IMG src="images/refactor/refactor_inline2.png" border="1"/></p><br/>

	
	<hr/>
	<p>
		<strong>Extracting a variable</strong>: Ok, it just wasn't what we wanted, so, let's make the opposite refactoring,
		let's extract a variable from the self.newMethod() call. Mark it and press <strong>Alt+Shift+L</strong> and set the
		name to 'newVar'
	</p>
	<br/><p align="center"><IMG src="images/refactor/refactor_extract_var1.png" border="1"/></p><br/>

	
	<p>
		That would give us the following result:
	</p>
	<br/><p align="center"><IMG src="images/refactor/refactor_extract_var2.png" border="1"/></p><br/>

	
	<p>
		And that's it for the refactoring... hope you enjoy it.
