<p>Ok, now that you're already up and running with PyDev, there are some useful tips presented below to make your coding more
enjoyable:
</p><br/>

<ul>

<li>1. <strong>Learn the keybindings provided by PyDev and Eclipse</strong>: As with any other environment, you'll have to learn 
what can be done (and how). In the reference manual, there is a session dedicated just to that...
</li>

<li>2. <strong>Search for what you need</strong>: Eclipse is a platform that has literally hundreds of plugins. If you want something that
you are missing, search for it... you never know what you can find!
</li>

<li>3. If there is something you <strong>wish PyDev had</strong>, but it doesn't, drop a note at the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=85796&atid=577332">feature request tracker</a> at 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=85796&atid=577332">sourceforge</a>... who knows, it might
be the next implemented feature ;-)
</li>

</ul>

<p>And that's it... if you got here, you already 'graduated' to the 'intermediate level'... You can continue with the
manual clicking on 'next'. The reference manual will present you the features that are available within PyDev and
give you much more information on how to effectively use your platform.
