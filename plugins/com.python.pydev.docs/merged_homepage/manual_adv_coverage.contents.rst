Code coverage
================

Requisites
-----------

To use the code coverage integration in PyDev, the coverage module is needed. It may
be gotten from: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/coverage (the integration is tested with version 3.4, so, this is the 
recommended version).

After installing it (which may be done through easy_install coverage), don't forget to refresh your interpreter
configuration so that the coverage module is properly recognized by PyDev.

Usage
------

To use the code coverage view, first open it (window > show view > code coverage)

Then, drag the folder which should have coverage info obtained
