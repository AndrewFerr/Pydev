Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
lint Python modules using external checkers.                            
                                                                               
This is the main checker controling the other ones and the reports         
generation. It is itself both a raw checker and an astng checker in order  
to:                                                                        
* handle message activation / deactivation at the module level             
* handle some basic but necessary stats'data (number of classes, methods...)
                                                                                
This checker also defines the following reports:                                    
  * R0001: Total errors / warnings                                              
  * R0002: % errors / warnings by module                                        
  * R0003: Messages
