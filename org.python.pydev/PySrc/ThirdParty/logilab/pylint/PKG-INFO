Description: Pylint is tool to analyze Python source code looking for bugs and signs
        of poor quality. It can check if a module satisfies a coding standard.
        Pylint can be seen as another PyChecker since nearly all tests you can
        do with PyChecker can also be done with Pylint. However, Pylint offers
        some more features, like checking line-code's length, checking if
        variable names are well-formed according to your coding standard, or
        checking if declared interfaces are truly implemented, and much more.
        .
        Additionnaly, it is possible to write plugins to add your own checks,
        using a plugin mechanism.
