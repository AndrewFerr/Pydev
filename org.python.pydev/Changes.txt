org.python.pydev

Since 0.3

New features:

- Added team file extensions for .py & .pyc
- Added "Source" menu to the editor: comment/goto methods implemented by fabioz
- Added Python nature, and nature icon. Nature get automatically added to any project
that opens a python editor.
- Added Python properties to projects that have Python nature
- Editor now has a python icon. Icon is ugly, help!
- .pyc files are filtered in the resource view
- Parsing now happens either immediately on return, or a second after the last typing.
This makes error notifications nicer and more predictable

Bug fixes:
- Moved parsing so that all pydev parsers use single thread
-
