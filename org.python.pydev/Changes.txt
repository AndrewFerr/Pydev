org.python.pydev

Since 0.3

New features:

- Added team file extensions for .py & .pyc
- Added "Source" menu to the editor: comment/goto methods implemented by fabioz
- Added Python nature, and nature icon. Nature get automatically added to any project
that opens a python editor.
- Added Python properties to projects that have Python nature
- Editor now has a python icon. Icon is ugly, help!
- .pyc files are filtered out in the resource view
- Parsing now happens either immediately on return, or a second after input
This makes error notifications nicer and more predictable
- New double-clicking strategy, copied from Java
- Moved debug preferences into main plugin. We need them for import paths parsing
- Hyperlinks on simple imports now work. For them to find system includes, you'll need to
set up the python interpreter in the preferences.
	active hyperlinks are:
		[imports] import sys: you can click on sys, and sys.py will open
		[local function calls]: functions defined in the same file
		[class constructors]: a = SomeClass() takes you to class definition
		[self.method calls]: self.method_name works if method is defined in the same file
- When you are editing in the tab mode, paste will replace spaces with tabs
- tabs/spaces conversion only takes place inside code, not inside comments

Bug fixes:
- Moved parsing so that all pydev parsers use single thread
-
