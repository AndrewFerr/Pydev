- hierarchy view: show with f4 / close / open view / f4 (will not work)
- DEBUGGER BUG: if a class is defined within a method, things later in that method are not able to get the correct name for the breakpoint scope (cannot reproduce?)
- Debugger: enable users to configure the mappings for remote debugging in a 'nice' way.
- The filter for the name of tests to ignore when running pyunit should be asked at run-time (with user-option to not show it).
- When opening a python file, it should try to 'adapt' to the current indent style used (and give warnings about wrong stuff).
- Ctrl+2+ XXX should be case-independent.
- Ctrl+* should enable/disable mark occurrences
- Variable highlight doesn't respect local scope (all docstrings are gotten in the file when renaming a local variable)
- Add breakpoint if file is zip
- Mark new project as python 2.5

- Enable users to work with zip files and integrate better with java (jars and ast structure).
	- Simple support (code-completion / modules): OK
	- Go to definition: OK, but needs changing to NameLookup in findDefinition (better API reference -- internal, but we'll be using it in another place, so, it'll have to be supported anyway) 
	- Context insensitive import: OK
	- Debugger
	- .pyd inside zip file (handled but not tested): 
		- ModulesManager: else if(PythonPathHelper.isValidDll(emptyModuleForZip.pathInZip)){
		
- Change the stdout/stderr for unicode
- CNF: Go into / up in pydev package explorer: http://richclientplatform.blogspot.com/2007/07/adding-go-into-and-go-up-to-cnf.html
- Option to add line at end of file
- Generate log for reporting errors
- Rename refactoring: check for overriden methods
- Remote debugging: use module name is possible?

- pressing enter just before 'class' has strange indent!

- occurrences case:
def m1():
    _expr, attr = 1, 3

    def filter():
        return attr <-- mark occurrences here!
        
console:
	- getpass: echo mode
	- undo/redo for current line
	- colors config
	- OK: esc: clear current line
	- pg up/down: console history in dialog
	- start writing: move cursor automatically to command line
	- correct messages (translation)
	- qualifier match context insensitive

- Try to reproduce:
