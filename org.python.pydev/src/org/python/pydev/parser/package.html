Pydev interface to Python parser.

<p>Every {@link org.python.pydev.editor.PyEdit PyEdit} has a PyParser associated with it.
The parser continuously parses the input into AST (Abstract Syntax Tree). 
Listeners can register with PyParser to receive events when parse is complete.
<p>PyParser is used by everyone who needs access to the underlying Python structure: 
{@link org.python.pydev.outline.ParsedModel outliner}, 
{@link org.python.pydev.editor.dictionary.PyDEditorItem dictionary}.
