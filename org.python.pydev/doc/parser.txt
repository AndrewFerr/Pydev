Python parser has to be modified.
Imported all the modified files from jython
Eliminated all imports from org.python.core
Created a new class called Py that implements commonly used Py methods (makeInt & friends)

org.python.parser.ast.Num:
> global replace of PyObject with String

org.python.parser.SimpleNode:
> pickleThis takes object instead of PyObject

org.python.parser.PythonGrammar
> minor changes, mostly with calling Py instead of python.core
