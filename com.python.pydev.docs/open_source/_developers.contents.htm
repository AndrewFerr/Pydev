This page shows how to effectively get up and running with the pydev code. <br/>

<h2>Getting the code</h2>

The first thing you probably want to do in order to code in pydev is <strong>getting its code</strong>. As pydev is an Eclipse plugin, 
the whole process will be explained based on the Eclipse infrastructure (this was written for the sdk version 3.1).<br/><br/>

<strong>Pre-requisites:</strong> Eclipse SDK 3.1 and Java 5.0<br/><br/>

Before getting the code, there's an important step you need to make: Change your java 'compiler compliance-level' to 5.0.
To do this, go to <strong>window > preferences > Java > compiler</strong> and change that setting from <strong>1.4 to 5.0</strong>.<br/><br/>

The steps to get the code are:<br/><br/>
1. Open the cvs repositories view <strong>(window > show view > cvs > cvs repositories)</strong><br/><br/>
2. Right-click the view and choose <strong>new > repository location</strong> and fill:<br/>
<ul>
	<li>host: cvs.sourceforge.net</li>
	<li>repository path: /cvsroot/pydev</li>
	<li>user: anonymous</li>
	<li>password: this field should be left empty</li>
	<li>connection type: pserver</li>
</ul><br/>
As pointed in the image below:

And click <strong>Finish</strong><br/><br/>

3. You should now have that repository added to your cvs repositories, so, expand it 2 levels: the root and the head (assuming you
want to get the latest version), select the <strong>11 folders marked in the image below</strong>, 
right-click it and choose <strong>check out</strong> (the other folders are 'deprecated'). 
<br/><br/><center><img src="images/developers/repository_added.png" border=1/></center><br/><br/>

By doing so, Eclipse should automatically grab all the sources from the cvs into your workspace and let
the whole structure ready for you to begin coding pydev.<br/><br/>

After you do that, you'll probably note that the tests <strong>did not compile successfully</strong>. This is because there are some settings
that will depend on your installation. You have to create the class that holds that info. There is a 'template' for that file in the cvs at: 
<strong>org.python.pydev.core/TestDependent.template</strong>. You should create a copy of that file in that same dir named 
<strong>TestDependent.java</strong> and set the needed things according to your installation. If there is still something that does
not compile, it may mean that: <br/>
<ul>
	<li>The cvs is not properly synched across the developers and non-developers (yes, it takes some time for that to happen)</li>
	<li>There is something missing in that TestDependent.java file because it is not synched with all the dependencies (if so, just add the needed variable to it)</li>
	<li>The head does not compile in the cvs -- if you believe that is the case, send an e-mail to the pydev-code list at sourceforge to know what's happening.</li>
</ul>
<br/>


<h2>Where to start?</h2>

Ok, this may be the most difficult thing... especially because answers may change a lot depending on what you want to do, so, below are 
outlined 2 different approaches: <br/><br/>

<ul>
	<li>Extending Pydev <strong>with Jython</strong>: recommended if you want to add some editor-related action or something that does not need implementing some Eclipse extension-point.</li>
	<li>Extending Pydev <strong>in Java</strong>: if you want something that won't map to an action, this might be the better way to go.</li>
</ul>

To start in any of those approaches it might be worth taking a look at some Eclipse documentation, to try to grasp some of its concepts. One of
the finest documentations for that is the <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/Eclipse_FAQs">Eclipse FAQ</a>.<br/><br/>

If you want to take the Jython approach, there is an article on how to do
<a href="http://fabioz.com/pydev/manual_articles_scripting.html">jython scripting in pydev</a><br/><br/>

And that's it. If you have further doubts about how to code in pydev, direct your questions to 
the <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/pydev-code">pydev-code list</a> at sourceforge.<br/><br/>

<strong>Good Luck!</strong>
