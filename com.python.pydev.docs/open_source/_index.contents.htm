<h3>What is PyDev?</h3>

PyDev is a plugin that enables users to use <strong>Eclipse</strong> for <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>Jython</strong> development 
-- making Eclipse a first class <strong>Python IDE</strong> --
It comes with many goodies such as code completion, syntax highlighting, syntax analysis, 
refactor, debug and many others. If you want more details on
the provided features, you can check <strong><a href="features.html">here</a></strong>.

Pydev now has a new 'partner': <strong><a href="http://www.fabioz.com/pydev">Pydev Extensions</a></strong>. It works with Pydev, 
and delivers a number of features that can make it
an <strong>'unique'</strong> environment, providing (among other features) <strong>code-analysis</strong> (does not depend on external features
and is much faster), <strong>code completion with auto-import</strong>, a much better implementation of <strong>go to definition</strong>, 
remote debugging, 'quick-fixes', etc.<br/><br/>
