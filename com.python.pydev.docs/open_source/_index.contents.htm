<h3>What is PyDev?</h3>

PyDev is a plugin that enables users to use <strong>Eclipse</strong> for <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>Jython</strong> development. 
It comes with many goodies such as code completion, syntax highlighting, syntax analysis, 
refactor, debug and many others. If you want more details on
the provided features, you can check <strong><a href="features.html">here</a></strong>.

<h3>PyDev Extensions <IMG src="images/general/new.png" border="0" ></h3>

Pydev now has a new 'partner': <a href="http://www.fabioz.com/pydev">Pydev Extensions</a>. It works with Pydev, 
and delivers a number of features that can make it
a 'unique' environment, providing (among other features) code-analysis (does not depend on external features
and is much faster), code completion with auto-import, remote debugging, better go to definition and 'quick-fixes'.<br/><br/>
