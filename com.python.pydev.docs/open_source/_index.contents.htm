<h3>What is PyDev?</h3>

PyDev is a plugin that enables users to use <strong>Eclipse</strong> for <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>Jython</strong> development 
-- making Eclipse a first class <strong>Python IDE</strong> --
It comes with many goodies such as code completion, syntax highlighting, syntax analysis, 
refactor, debug and many others. If you want more details on
the provided features, you can check <strong><a href="features.html">here</a></strong>.

Pydev now has a new 'partner': <strong><a href="http://www.fabioz.com/pydev">Pydev Extensions</a></strong>. It works with Pydev, 
and delivers a number of features that can make it
an <strong>'unique'</strong> environment, providing (among other features) <strong>code-analysis</strong> (does not depend on external features
and is much faster), <strong>code completion with auto-import</strong>, a much better implementation of <strong>go to definition</strong>, 
remote debugging, 'quick-fixes', etc.<br/><br/>

<h2>News: </h2>



<h3>New Release: LAST_VERSION_TAG</h3>

<h4>Major highlights:</h4>


<ul>
<li>Completions for parameters based on the tokens that were defined for it in a given context
</li><li>Removed the default PyLint options, because its command-line interface changed (that was crashing PyLint in newer versions)
</li><li>Changed the grammar so that 'yield' is correctly parsed as an expression
</li><li>Giving better error message when external file is opened without any interpreter selected
</li><li>Icons for the builtins gotten on large libraries (such as wx -- it was optimized not to do that before)
</li><li>Adding jars relative to the project now works correctly
</li><li><strong>Patched (Javier Sanz): </strong>The debugger is now able to get the variables in a context when handling negative payloads
</li>

</ul>



<h3>New Release: 1.2.3</h3>

<h4>Major highlights:</h4>

<ul>
<li>When the user specifies an invalid interpreter, a better error report is given (previously it was only shown in the error log)
</li><li>When threads die, the debugger is notified about it (so that they are removed from the stack)
</li><li>Writing the preferences to the disk is now buffered
</li><li>Fixed problem when debugging in jython with the statement "from xxx import *"
</li><li>Fixed one issue with the indentation engine
</li><li>Commenting a line does not remove a blank line in the end anymore
</li><li>Added debug mode for unit-test 
</li><li>Added the possibility of setting the <strong>-Dpython.cachedir</strong> for running the jython shell (errors can arise in unix-based machines if jython is not able to write its cache)
