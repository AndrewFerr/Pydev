<h3>New Release: LAST_VERSION_TAG</h3>

<h4>Major highlights:</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Eclipse 3.3 Integration:</strong> Does not keep eclipse from a correct shutdown anymore.</li>
<li><strong>Docstrings and code completion pop-up:</strong> </li>
<ul>
    <li>The docstrings are now wrapped to the size of the pop-up window.</li>
    <li>The initial columns with whitespaces that are common for all the docstring is now removed.</li>
    <li>The previous size of the pop-up window in completions is now restored.</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Extract method refactoring:</strong> was not adding 'if' statement correctly on a specific case.</li>
<li><strong>Organize imports:</strong> (Ctrl+Shift+O): comments are not erased in import lines when using it anymore.</li>
<li><strong>Interpreter Config:</strong> solved a concurrency issue (which could issue an exception when configuring the interpreter).</li>
<li><strong>Jython integration:</strong> can now work with a j9 vm.</li>
<li><strong>Jython integration:</strong> those that don't use jython can now use eclipse without JDT (but it's still required for jython development).</li>
<li><strong>Outline:</strong> </li>
<ul>
    <li>The comments are now set in the correct level (below module, class or method).</li>
    <li>Comments are sorted by their position even when alphabetic sorting is in place.</li>
    <li>Comments are added to the outline if they start or <strong>end</strong> with '---'.</li>
</ul>
</ul>



<h4>Previous: 1.3.4</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Debugger:</strong> Breakpoints working correctly on external files opened with 'File > Open File...'.</li>
<li><strong>Debugger:</strong> Python 2.5 accepts breakpoints in the module level.</li>
<li><strong>Debugger:</strong> Unicode variables can be shown in the variables view.</li>
<li><strong>Editor:</strong> Coding try..except / try..finally auto-dedents.</li>
<li><strong>Code Completion:</strong> __builtins__ considered a valid completion</li>
<li><strong>Pydev Package Explorer:</strong> Opens files with correct editor (the pydev editor was forced).</li>
</ul>



<h4>Previous: 1.3.3</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Performance:</strong> Optimizations in the code-completion structure.</li>
<li><strong>Debugger:</strong> Performance improvements (it will only actually trace contexts that have breakpoints -- it was doing that in a module context before).</li>
<li><strong>Debugger:</strong> Step over correctly stops at the previous context.</li>
<li><strong>Debugger:</strong> Breakpoint labels correct when class/function name changes.</li>
<li><strong>Quick-Fix:</strong> Move import to global scope would not be correct if the last line was a multi-line import.</li>
<li><strong>Outline:</strong> Syntax errors will show in the outline.</li>
<li><strong>Outline:</strong> Selection on import nodes is now correct.</li>
<li><strong>Outline:</strong> Link with editor created.</li>
<li><strong>Outline:</strong> Show in outline added to the pydev perspective.</li>
<li><strong>Find Previous Problem:</strong> action created (<strong>Ctrl+Shift+.</strong>).</li>
<li><strong>Extract method refactoring:</strong> end line delimiters are gotten according to the document (it was previously fixed to \n).</li>
<li><strong>Extension-points:</strong> Documentation added for some of the extension points available.</li>
<li><strong>Perspective:</strong> The pydev package explorer has been set as the preferred browser in the pydev perspective.</li>
</ul>
