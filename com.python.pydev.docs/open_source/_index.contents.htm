<h3>New Release: LAST_VERSION_TAG</h3>

<h4>Major highlights:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/mylar/">Mylar</a> integration</strong>: the pydev package explorer now supports <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/mylar/">mylar</a> (must be downloaded as a separate feature: org.python.pydev.mylar.feature)</li>
<li><strong>Code-completion</strong>: comment completion is now the same as string completion</li>
<li><strong>Debug</strong>: Breakpoints can be set in external files</li>
<li><strong>Debug</strong>: Breakpoint annotations now show in external files</li>
<li><strong>Package Explorer</strong>: created filter for import nodes</li>
<li><strong>Fix: Package Explorer Actions</strong>: Open action does not expand children when opening python file</li>
<li><strong>Fix: Project Explorer (WTP) integration</strong>: does not conflict with elements from other plugins anymore (such as java projects)</li>
<li><strong>Fix: halt in new project wizard</strong>: when creating a new project from the pydev wizard it was halting in some platforms</li>
<li><strong>Fix: ${string_prompt} in run config</strong>: now only evaluated on the actual run</li>
<li><strong>Fix: Code-Completion</strong>: jython shell was not handling java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError correctly</li>
</ul>



<h4>Previous: 1.3.0</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Code-completion</strong>: Deep analysis for discovering arguments in constructs 'from imports' now can be configured given the number of chars of the qualifier</li>
<li><strong>Refactoring for override methods</strong>: changed so that it uses the pydev code-completion engine for getting the hierarchy and methods</li>
<li><strong>Fix: Python Nature Restore</strong>: begin rule does not match outer scope rule fixed</li>
<li><strong>Fix: Package Explorer</strong>: if show-in is in a deep structure, it will show it is the 1st try and not only in the 2nd</li>
<li><strong>Fix: Package Explorer</strong>: some intercepts removed elements incorrectly, and ended up messing the navigator and search (which has 'null' elements because of that)</li>
</ul>


<h4>Previous: 1.2.8</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Refactoring</strong>: integration of the <a href="http://sifsstud2.hsr.ch/peptic">PEPTIC refactoring engine</a></li>
<li><strong>Package Explorer</strong>: many fixes (special thanks for Don Taylor for the bug reports)</li>
<li><strong>Debugger</strong>: a number of small optimizations</li>
<li><strong>Code-completion</strong>: works in emacs mode</li>
<li><strong>Code-completion</strong>: added the possibility of auto-completing for all letter chars and '_' (so, it starts completing once you start writing)</li>
<li><strong>Code-completion</strong>: code-completion for epydoc inside strings</li>
<li><strong>Code-completion</strong>: assigns after global statement considered added to the global namespace</li>
<li><strong>Code-completion</strong>: now works when a class is declared in a nested scope</li>
<li><strong>Code-completion</strong>: if multiple assigns are found to some variable, the completion will be a merge of them</li>
<li><strong>Code-completion</strong>: functions are analyzed for their return values for code-completion purposes</li>
<li><strong>Code-completion</strong>: working on multi-line imports</li>
<li><strong>Code-completion</strong>: can discover instance variables not declared in the class (in the scope where the class was instanced)</li>
<li><strong>Auto-edit</strong>: adds 'self', 'cls' or no parameter based on the @clasmethod, @staticmethod declaration on previous line</li>
<li><strong>Auto-edit</strong>: doesn't add 'self' if a method is declared in a method inner scope</li>
<li><strong>Fix: BRM Refactoring</strong>: wrong column was being passed to the BRM refactoring engine</li>
<li><strong>Code-folding</strong>: added for comments and strings</li>
<li><strong>Fix</strong>: sometimes the 'create docstring' assistant was not recognizing method definitons</li>
</ul>
