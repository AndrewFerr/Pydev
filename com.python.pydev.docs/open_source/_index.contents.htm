<h3>What is Pydev?</h3>

Pydev is a plugin that enables users to use <strong>Eclipse</strong> for <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>Jython</strong> development 
-- making Eclipse a first class <strong>Python IDE</strong> --
It comes with many goodies such as code completion, syntax highlighting, syntax analysis, 
refactor, debug and many others. If you want more details on
the provided features, you can check <strong><a href="features.html">here</a></strong>.

<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Pydev</strong> and <strong>Pydev Extensions</strong> are now products of <strong>Aptana</strong>, makers of the popular Aptana Studio, 
Eclipse-based IDE for Ajax, Jaxer, Ruby on Rails, and PHP.  
You can plug Pydev into Aptana Studio or both into Eclipse and use them side by side.  
Aptana plans deeper integrations in the future.  <a href="http://www.aptana.com/blog/pcolton/pydev_news">See the news</a>.

<strong><a href="http://www.fabioz.com/pydev">Pydev Extensions</a></strong>
is a plugin that works with Pydev, providing many other features such as <strong>code-analysis</strong>, 
<strong>code completion with auto-import</strong>, a much better implementation of <strong>go to definition, 
remote debugging, 'quick-fixes', mark-occurrences</strong>, among others.<br/><br/>
