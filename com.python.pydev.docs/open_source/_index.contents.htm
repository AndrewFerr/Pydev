<h3>PyDev Extensions <IMG src="images/general/new.png" border="0" /></h3>

Pydev now has a new 'partner': <a href="http://www.fabioz.com/pydev">Pydev Extensions</a>. It works with Pydev, 
and delivers a number of features that can make it
a 'unique' environment, providing (among other features) code-analysis (does not depend on external features
and is much faster), code completion with auto-import, remote debugging, better go to definition, 'quick-fixes'....<br/><br/>
