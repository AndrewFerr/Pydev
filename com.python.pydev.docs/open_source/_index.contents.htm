<h3>What is PyDev?</h3>

PyDev is a plugin that enables users to use <strong>Eclipse</strong> for <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>Jython</strong> development 
-- making Eclipse a first class <strong>Python IDE</strong> --
It comes with many goodies such as code completion, syntax highlighting, syntax analysis, 
refactor, debug and many others. If you want more details on
the provided features, you can check <strong><a href="features.html">here</a></strong>.

<strong><a href="http://www.fabioz.com/pydev">Pydev Extensions</a></strong>
is a plugin that works with PyDev, providing many other features such as <strong>code-analysis</strong>, 
<strong>code completion with auto-import</strong>, a much better implementation of <strong>go to definition, 
remote debugging, 'quick-fixes', mark-occurrences</strong>, among others.<br/><br/>

<h3>New Release: LAST_VERSION_TAG</h3>

<h4>Major highlights:</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Jython Integration</strong>: Java modules may be referenced from pydev projects (working with code-completion, go to definition, etc).</li>
<li><strong>Jython Debugger</strong>: Does not attempt to run untraced threads if version &lt;= 2.2.1 (this was a Jython bug that's patched for the current trunk --
<strong>note:</strong> it prevented the debugger from working correctly with Jython).</li>

<li><strong>Project build</strong>: Only referenced projects are rebuilt (and not all projects in the workspace -- e.g.: unreferenced c++ projects).</li>

<li><strong>Spell checking (depends on JDT)</strong>: Integrated for comments and strings within pydev (eclipse 3.4 should add the 
support for working without JDT. Reference: <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/platform-text/3.4/plan.php">
http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/platform-text/3.4/plan.php</a>).</li>

<li><strong>Files without extension</strong>: A file without extension can have code-completion / go to definition (as long as the others around it do have extensions)</li>
<li><strong>Debug</strong>: Variable substitution is no longer asked twice in debug mode.</li>
<li><strong>Custom Filters</strong>: User-defined filters can be specified in the <strong>Pydev package explorer</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Debugger</strong>: performance improvements to get the existing frames for Python 2.4 and Jython 2.1.</li>
<li><strong>Outline view</strong>: Better refresh (doesn't collapse the tree for simple structure changes).</li>

<li><strong>Undo limit</strong>: The undo limit set in window > preferences > general > editors > text editors works for pydev.</li>
<li><strong>Editor: Tabs as spaces</strong>: The newly added 'insert spaces for tabs' in the general preferences was conflicting with pydev (those settings are now ignored)</li>

<li><strong>Patch by Laurent Dore</strong>: Added filter for *.py~ and comments</li>
<li><strong>Delete *.pyc action</strong>: also deletes *.pyo files</li>
<li><strong>Ctrl+Click</strong>: behaves exactly as F3.</li>
<li><strong>Dedent</strong>: No auto-dedent after yield</li>
</ul>


<h4>Previous: 1.3.10</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Symlinks</strong> supported in the system pythonpath configuration.</li>
<li><strong>Egg/zip</strong> files are now supported.</li>
<li>The creation of a project in a non-default location is now allowed within the workspace</li>
<li><strong>JDT</strong> used to get completions from jars (but referencing other java projects is still not supported).</li>
<li>Configuration of pythonpath allows multiple selection for removal.</li>
<li>Configuration of pythonpath allows multiple jars/zips to be added at once.</li>
<li>When configuring the pythonpath, the paths are sorted for selection.</li>
<li>The file extensions that pydev recognizes for python can now be customized.</li>
<li>Patch by <strong>Carl Robinson</strong>: <strong>Code-folding</strong> for elements such as for, try, while, etc.</li>
<li>Removed the go to next/previous problem annotation (Eclipse 3.3 already provides a default implementation for it).</li>
</ul>



<h4>Previous: 1.3.9</h4>

<ul>
<li>Fixed problem when configuring jython</li>
<li>Patch from <strong>paulj</strong>: debbugger working with jython 2.2rc2</li>
<li>Patch from <strong>Oskar Heck</strong>: debbugger can change globals</li>
<li>Added action to <strong>delete all .pyc / $py.class</strong> files</li>
<li>Added actions to <strong>add/remove the pydev configuration from a project</strong> (previously, the only way to add a nature was to open a python file within a project).</li>
<li><strong>Ctrl+Shift+O</strong>: When used with a selection will consider lines ending with \ (without selection organizes imports)</li>
<li>Auto-add "import" string will not be added when adding a space in the case: from xxximport (just after from xxx)</li>
<li>Templates created with tabs (or spaces indent) are now converted to the indent being used in the editor</li>
<li>Hide non-pydev projects filter working</li>
<li>Don't show assignments/imports after <strong>if __name__ == '__main__'</strong>: in outline</li>
<li><strong>Code-completion</strong>: after a completion is requested, pressing '.' will apply that completion (and if it has parameters, they'll not be added).</li>
<li><strong>Code-completion</strong>: when a code-completion is applied with Ctrl pressed (toggle mode), parameters are not added.</li>
<li><strong>Assign to local</strong> variable/attribute handles <strong>constants</strong> correctly.</li>
<li><strong>psyco</strong> changed for Null object for <strong>debug</strong> (so, no changes are required to the code if psyco is used while debugging).</li>
<li><strong>Code-folding</strong> annotations won't change places.</li>
<li><strong>Pydev package explorer</strong> will correctly show outline for files if the project root is set as a source folder.</li>
<li><strong>Pydev package explorer</strong>: folders under the pythonpath have a package icon.</li>
<li>Unittest runner: handles <strong>multiple selection</strong>.</li>
</ul>
