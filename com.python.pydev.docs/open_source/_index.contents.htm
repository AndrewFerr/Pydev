<h3>New Release: LAST_VERSION_TAG</h3>

<h4>Major highlights:</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Pydev Editor:</strong> If multiple editors are open for the same file, a parser is shared among them (which greatly improves the performance in this case)</li>
<li><strong>Pydev Editor:</strong> Backspace is now indentation-aware (so, it'll try to dedent to legal levels)</li>
<li><strong>Pydev Editor:</strong> sometimes the 'import' string was added when it shouldn't</li>
<li><strong>Fix: Code-completion:</strong> case where a package shadows a .pyd is now controlled (this happened with mxDateTime.pyd)</li>
<li><strong>Fix: Code-completion:</strong> recursion condition was wrongly detected</li>
<li><strong>Fix: Code-completion:</strong> halting condition was found and removed</li>
<li><strong>Fix: Project Config:</strong> if a closed project was referenced, no project was gathered for any operation (e.g.: code-completion)</li>
<li><strong>Fix:</strong> The filter for showing only pydev projects is not active by default anymore</li>
</ul>



<h4>Previous: 1.3.1</h4>

<h4>Previous: 1.3.0</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Code-completion</strong>: Deep analysis for discovering arguments in constructs 'from imports' now can be configured given the number of chars of the qualifier</li>
<li><strong>Refactoring for override methods</strong>: changed so that it uses the pydev code-completion engine for getting the hierarchy and methods</li>
<li><strong>Fix: Python Nature Restore</strong>: begin rule does not match outer scope rule fixed</li>
<li><strong>Fix: Package Explorer</strong>: if show-in is in a deep structure, it will show it is the 1st try and not only in the 2nd</li>
<li><strong>Fix: Package Explorer</strong>: some intercepts removed elements incorrectly, and ended up messing the navigator and search (which has 'null' elements because of that)</li>
</ul>
