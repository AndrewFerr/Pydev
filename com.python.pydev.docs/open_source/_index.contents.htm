<strong><a href="http://www.fabioz.com/pydev">Pydev Extensions</a></strong>
is a plugin that works with PyDev, providing many other features such as <strong>code-analysis</strong>,

<h3>New Release: LAST_VERSION_TAG</h3>

<h4>Major highlights:</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Symlinks</strong> supported in the system pythonpath configuration.</li>
<li><strong>Egg/zip</strong> files are now supported.</li>
<li>The creation of a project in a non-default location is now allowed within the workspace</li>
<li><strong>JDT</strong> used to get completions from jars (but referencing other java projects is still not supported).</li>
<li>Configuration of pythonpath allows multiple selection for removal.</li>
<li>Configuration of pythonpath allows multiple jars/zips to be added at once.</li>
<li>When configuring the pythonpath, the paths are sorted for selection.</li>
<li>The file extensions that pydev recognizes for python can now be customized.</li>
<li>Patch by <strong>Carl Robinson</strong>: <strong>Code-folding</strong> for elements such as for, try, while, etc.</li>
<li>Removed the go to next/previous problem annotation (Eclipse 3.3 already provides a default implementation for it).</li>
</ul>



<h4>Previous: 1.3.9</h4>

<ul>
<li>Fixed problem when configuring jython</li>
<li>Patch from <strong>paulj</strong>: debbugger working with jython 2.2rc2</li>
<li>Patch from <strong>Oskar Heck</strong>: debbugger can change globals</li>
<li>Added action to <strong>delete all .pyc / $py.class</strong> files</li>
<li>Added actions to <strong>add/remove the pydev configuration from a project</strong> (previously, the only way to add a nature was to open a python file within a project).</li>
<li><strong>Ctrl+Shift+O</strong>: When used with a selection will consider lines ending with \ (without selection organizes imports)</li>
<li>Auto-add "import" string will not be added when adding a space in the case: from xxximport (just after from xxx)</li>
<li>Templates created with tabs (or spaces indent) are now converted to the indent being used in the editor</li>
<li>Hide non-pydev projects filter working</li>
<li>Don't show assignments/imports after <strong>if __name__ == '__main__'</strong>: in outline</li>
<li><strong>Code-completion</strong>: after a completion is requested, pressing '.' will apply that completion (and if it has parameters, they'll not be added).</li>
<li><strong>Code-completion</strong>: when a code-completion is applied with Ctrl pressed (toggle mode), parameters are not added.</li>
<li><strong>Assign to local</strong> variable/attribute handles <strong>constants</strong> correctly.</li>
<li><strong>psyco</strong> changed for Null object for <strong>debug</strong> (so, no changes are required to the code if psyco is used while debugging).</li>
<li><strong>Code-folding</strong> annotations won't change places.</li>
<li><strong>Pydev package explorer</strong> will correctly show outline for files if the project root is set as a source folder.</li>
<li><strong>Pydev package explorer</strong>: folders under the pythonpath have a package icon.</li>
<li>Unittest runner: handles <strong>multiple selection</strong>.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Previous: 1.3.8</h4>

<ul>
<li>Fixed problems related to the pydev package explorer that appeared when using <strong>java 1.6</strong> (ConcurrentModificationException)</li>
<li>Other minor bug-fixes</li>
</ul>


<h4>Previous: 1.3.7</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Support for Eclipse 3.3</strong></li>
<li><strong>Bug Fix</strong>: Interpreter modules not correctly set/persisted after specifying interpreter (so, the builtins and other system libraries would not be available in completions).</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/mylyn/">Mylyn</a> integration</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Open With Pydev</strong>: does not appear for containers anymore.</li>
<li><strong>Code-completion:</strong> </li>
The folowing cases are now considered in code-completion to discover the type of a variable:
<ul>
	<strong>Type/Interface checking:</strong> (note that 'assert' is required)
	<li>assert isinstance(obj, Interface) -- default from python</li>
	<li>assert Interface.implementedBy(obj) -- zope</li>
	<li>assert IsImplementation(obj, Interface) -- custom request</li>
	<li>assert IsInterfaceDeclared(obj, Interface) -- custom request</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<strong>Factory methods</strong>
	<li>a = adapt(obj, Interface) -- pyprotocols</li>
	<li>a = obj.GetAdapter(Interface) -- custom request</li>
	<li>a = obj.get_adapter(Interface) -- custom request</li>
	<li>a = GetSingleton(Interface) -- custom request</li>
	<li>a = GetImplementation(Interface) -- custom request</li>
</ul>

</ul>
