<h3>New Release: LAST_VERSION_TAG</h3>

<h4>Major highlights:</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Bug Fix</strong>: Interpreter modules not correctly set/persisted after specifying interpreter (so, the builtins and other system libraries would not be available in completions).</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/mylyn/">Mylyn</a> integration</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Open With Pydev</strong>: does not appear for containers anymore.</li>
<li><strong>Code-completion:</strong> </li>
The folowing cases are now considered in code-completion to discover the type of a variable:
<ul>
	<strong>Type/Interface checking:</strong> (note that 'assert' is required)
	<li>assert isinstance(obj, Interface) -- default from python</li>
	<li>assert Interface.implementedBy(obj) -- zope</li>
	<li>assert IsImplementation(obj, Interface) -- custom request</li>
	<li>assert IsInterfaceDeclared(obj, Interface) -- custom request</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<strong>Factory methods</strong>
	<li>a = adapt(obj, Interface) -- pyprotocols</li>
	<li>a = obj.GetAdapter(Interface) -- custom request</li>
	<li>a = obj.get_adapter(Interface) -- custom request</li>
	<li>a = GetSingleton(Interface) -- custom request</li>
	<li>a = GetImplementation(Interface) -- custom request</li>
</ul>

</ul>


<h4>Previous: 1.3.6</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Bug Fix:</strong> Builtins were not correctly used after specifying interpreter (so, the builtins would not be available in completions/code-analysis).</li>
<li><strong>Patch (from Carl Robinson):</strong> PyLint severities can now be specified.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Previous: 1.3.5</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Eclipse 3.3 Integration:</strong> Does not keep eclipse from a correct shutdown anymore.</li>
<li><strong>Docstrings and code completion pop-up:</strong> </li>
<ul>
    <li>The docstrings are now wrapped to the size of the pop-up window.</li>
    <li>The initial columns with whitespaces that are common for all the docstring is now removed.</li>
    <li>The previous size of the pop-up window in completions is now restored.</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Extract method refactoring:</strong> was not adding 'if' statement correctly on a specific case.</li>
<li><strong>Organize imports:</strong> (Ctrl+Shift+O): comments are not erased in import lines when using it anymore.</li>
<li><strong>Interpreter Config:</strong> solved a concurrency issue (which could issue an exception when configuring the interpreter).</li>
<li><strong>Jython integration:</strong> can now work with a j9 vm.</li>
<li><strong>Jython integration:</strong> those that don't use jython can now use eclipse without JDT (but it's still required for jython development).</li>
<li><strong>Outline:</strong> </li>
<ul>
    <li>The comments are now set in the correct level (below module, class or method).</li>
    <li>Comments are sorted by their position even when alphabetic sorting is in place.</li>
    <li>Comments are added to the outline if they start or <strong>end</strong> with '---'.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
