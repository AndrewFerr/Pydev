<h3>What is PyDev?</h3>

PyDev is a plugin that enables users to use <strong>Eclipse</strong> for <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>Jython</strong> development 
-- making Eclipse a first class <strong>Python IDE</strong> --
It comes with many goodies such as code completion, syntax highlighting, syntax analysis, 
refactor, debug and many others. If you want more details on
the provided features, you can check <strong><a href="features.html">here</a></strong>.

Pydev now has a new 'partner': <strong><a href="http://www.fabioz.com/pydev">Pydev Extensions</a></strong>. It works with Pydev, 
and delivers a number of features that can make it
an <strong>'unique'</strong> environment, providing (among other features) <strong>code-analysis</strong> (does not depend on external features
and is much faster), <strong>code completion with auto-import</strong>, a much better implementation of <strong>go to definition</strong>, 
remote debugging, 'quick-fixes', etc.<br/><br/>

<h3>New Release: LAST_VERSION_TAG</h3>

<h4>Major highlights:</h4>




<strong>Code Completion</strong>
<ul>
<li>Calltips added to pydev
</li><li>The parameters are now linked when a completion is selected (so, tab iterates through them and enter goes to the end of the declaration)
</li><li>Parameters gotten from docstring analysis for builtins that don't work with 'inspect.getargspec'
</li><li>Getting completions for the pattern a,b,c=range(3) inside a class
</li><li>Code completion for nested modules had a bug fixed
</li><li>Added the 'toggle completion type' when ctrl is pressed in the code-completion for context-sensitive data
</li><li>Code-completion works correctly after instantiating a class: MyClass(). &lt;-- will bring correct completions
</li><li>Code-completion can now get the arguments passed when instatiating a class (getting the args from __init__)
</li><li>self is added as a parameter in the completion analyzing whether we're in a bounded or unbounded call
</li><li>Pressing Ctrl+Space a second time changes default / template completions
</li>
<strong>See <a href="http://pydev.blogspot.com/2006/07/improving-code-completion-in-pydev.html">details on toggling completion mode, cycling through completions and linked mode (blog)</a></strong>
