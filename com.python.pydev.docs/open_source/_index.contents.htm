Pydev now has a new 'partner': <strong><a href="http://www.fabioz.com/pydev">Pydev Extensions</a></strong>. It works with Pydev, 
and delivers a number of features that can make it
a <strong>'unique'</strong> environment, providing (among other features) <strong>code-analysis</strong> (does not depend on external features
and is much faster), <strong>code completion with auto-import</strong>, a much better implementation of <strong>go to definition</strong>, 
remote debugging, 'quick-fixes'....<br/><br/>
