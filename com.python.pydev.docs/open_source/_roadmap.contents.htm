<H3>Roadmap </H3>

<strong><P>What's next?</P></strong>

<p>
	Well, Pydev has never had a 'formal' roadmap, and this session is really just to make that clear ;-)
</p>

<p>
	So, what's to <strong>expect</strong> from it? Well, the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=85796&atid=577332">feature requests </a>
	are the features that are more likely to be implemented. Pydev development is mostly driven by the requests in that list (and 
	through <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=85796&atid=577329">bug reports</a>).
</p>

<p>
	The other 'source' of <strong>improvements</strong> is through code given by people that miss something, and instead of just reporting it and
	waiting to see if it gets implemented get so excited (or annoyed) that they just do it and contribute their code back to Pydev.
	(and that's the real <strong>magic</strong> of Open Source -- if you are in that team, you can check some quick instructions on how to get the 
	code and compile it at the <a href="developers.html">Developers manual</a>).
</p>

<p>
	Now, on to <strong>Release Cycles</strong>: Pydev usually has at least one release every month, and each release is always considered
	as a <strong>final version</strong>. So, you shouldn't worry when getting the latest version. If for some reason some <strong>
	critical bug</strong> is found in a version, you'll see another release pretty soon (something like 2-5 days after the release
	that presented that bug -- and sometimes even sooner).
