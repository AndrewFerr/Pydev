<H3>Code Completion</H3>

<p>
Code completion provides context-sensitive completions and is enabled with Ctrl+Space. (NOTE: eclipse has simple text-completion
by default in emacs-style with Alt+/).

<strong> Now, how to use it:</strong><br><br>

If you want to configure something, you have to go to
Window->preferences->PyDev->Code Completion.<br><br>
<br><br>

<br><br>
After setting the preferences, you have to set the PYTHONPATH you want to use for a certain project. 
To instructions on how to do it, check the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a>.
