<h3>Sponsoring</h3>

Well, PyDev is provided as an Open Source Project, but without some kind of support, it is really hard to keep any
project going, so, if you really like it and use it, you can help by 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/donate/index.php?group_id=85796">donating</a>.
Higher donations can receive some space in the homepage (contact me through my user in sourceforge:
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/users/fabioz/">fabioz</a> if you have interest).

<br/><br/>
Also, custom projects can be negociated. So, if you really want something that is not currently implemented 
in PyDev, you can contact me.

<li>This is my current employer, and it sponsors PyDev by letting me work on PyDev in some of my work-hours (not 
that many companies do that nowadays).<br/><br/>
<a href="http://www.esss.com.br">ESSS: Engineering Simulation and Scientific Software</a> is a company that 
develops scientific software. It creates customized software (scientific visualization and simulation)
for many engineering purposes (do I have to say we use Python and PyDev?), and makes consulting in 
engineering-related fields.<br/><br/>

<li>Without support from <a href="http://www.octetstring.com/">OctetString</a>, Jython support would not be possible!
