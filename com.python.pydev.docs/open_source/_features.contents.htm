<h2>New on: 0.9.8.7!!</h2>

<br/>
<li><strong>The debugger tracing was turned off </strong> (this was a bug in 0.9.8.6 and could make debugging much slower)

<br/>


<h2>New on: 0.9.8.6!!</h2>

<br/>

because it creates Python and Jython projects.
</li><li><strong>Added a new 'Pydev module' wizard (Mikko Ohtamaa contribution)</strong> -- NOTE: it still needs some work.
</li><li><strong>Changes in the shell spawning were done, and no hangs should appear when trying to do code-completion anymore </strong>
(if it still hapens, please report it as a bug -- NOTE: a little delay on the first time code-completion is executed
is expected, as this is the time the shell is started).
