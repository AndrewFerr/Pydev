<h1>TASKS!!!</h1>
<br>
<br>
Now I know where are those <b>TODO's</b> without making file searches.<br>
<br>
<br>
The TODO's can be configured in the tasks preferences page, so, fell free to use as many task tags (separated by spaces) as you want...<br>
<br>

<br>
The tasks should appear in the tasks view, so, you can check it.

<br>
The tasks are based on the builder, so, if you don't use the autobuild, you have to Ctrl+B once in a while to 
get the tasks updated.<br>
