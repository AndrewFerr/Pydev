defined in this folder.

Features that should be implemented
-----------------------------------

- Lint
- Code completion
- Organize imports


They should be done in the order listed above.


What else
---------

For releasing a commercial version, the features are not all that is needed. Other things that
are required are:

- Check the current libraries included in pydev for their licenses;
- Put a license file in each pydev plugin project;
- Fix all the source files and add the respective license for them;
- Make the pydev commercial license
- Create the homepage
- Create a licensing system
- Create the manual (html)
