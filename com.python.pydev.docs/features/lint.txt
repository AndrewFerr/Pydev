Lint feature
=============

Will always be active (altough the user may put all in ignore if he does not want to see the messages)


Warnings
--------

- Unused import 
- Unused variable (local, param - ignore when dummy / unused = user defined tokens)
- Duplicated signature (method, class)
- Reimported module
- Unexistant module


Errors
------
- Undefined variable


Concerns
--------
- Unused imports may or may not be detected on __init__
- Dependent modules should be re-analyzed after a module changes
- There should be a way to silent those warnings (with Ctrl+1)


To do later
-----------

- Member X not found.
- Base class' __init__ not called.
- Redefining X from outer scope.
- Calling function with wrong number of arguments (considerando *args e **kwargs, claro).
- Keyword argument does not exist:
   def foo(a, b): pass

   foo(x=1)
