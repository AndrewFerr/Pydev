Code Completion
===============

Context-Sensitive
-----------------

Current code completion (context-sensitive) features should be kept, 

Additions:
- completing on method returns (the method called should be analyzed to know what can it return).
- local imports should be considered when doing the code completion.


Not context-sensitive and Auto-import
-------------------------------------

The not context-sensitive code completion should work toghether with the auto-import feature.

What will it contain:
- modules available
- classes defined in the global scope
- methods defined in the global scope

Concerns
--------

- user should be able to select the number of characters that should be in the activation token in order to get 
the not context-sensitive completions
- compiled modules








auto-edit idea:

from xxx <- on space, add ' import '
