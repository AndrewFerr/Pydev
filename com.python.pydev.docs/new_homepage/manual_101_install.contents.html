<h3>Installing with the update site</h3>
<p>
To install Pydev and Pydev Extensions from the Eclipse Update Manager, you need to go to the install menu:
</p>

<br/><p align="center"><IMG src="images/install_menu.png" border="1"/></p><br/>

<p>Then select 'Search for new features for install' (You will follow the same path even if
you already have an older version installed).</p>

<br/><p align="center"><IMG src="images/install_select_new.png" border="1"/></p><br/>

<p>In the next screen (below), click 'new remote site'</p>

<br/><p align="center"><IMG src="images/update_sites.png" border="1"/></p><br/>

<p>Set the 'Pydev Extensions' update site: http://www.fabioz.com/pydev/updates
	<br/><br/>
	<strong>NOTE:</strong> if you currently have the sourceforge update site, you're advised to remove it (some
	reports pointed to some problems when having both).<br/><br/>
	<strong>NOTE:</strong> The only difference between the sourceforge update site and this one is that the one at sourceforge only contains
	the Pydev 'Open Source' version, and this one contains both.
</p>

<br/><p align="center"><IMG src="images/update_address.png" border="1"/></p><br/>

<p>Click 'Finish'. You should be presented with the screen below:</p>

<br/><p align="center"><IMG src="images/found_features.png" border="1"/></p><br/>

<p>Select both features and click 'next'... 
	<br/><br/>
	<strong>NOTE:</strong> if the features do not appear to you, you should restart Eclipse and try again (that's because
	Eclipse caches the results, and sometimes it may have the wrong version in its cache -- which is only cleared when you 
	restart Eclipse).
</p>

<br/><p align="center"><IMG src="images/update_license.png" border="1"/></p><br/>

<p>Now, you'll have to accept the license, click 'next' and in the next screen, review it and click 'finish'. Eclipse should automatically download
the plugin contents and present you to a dialog asking if you want to restart (to which you should say <strong>yes</strong>).</p>




<h3>Installing with the zip file</h3>

<p>After downloading the zip file (from <a href="http://www.fabioz.com/pydev/zips">http://www.fabioz.com/pydev/zips</a>), you have to extract it 
yourself on top of Eclipse. If you choose to do it, just make sure the plugins folder 
is extracted on top of the Eclipse plugins folder. After that, restart it with the '-clean' flag, to
make sure Eclipse finds out about it.</p>



<h3>Checking the installation</h3>
<p>
You can verify if it is correctly installed going to the menu <strong>'help > about > plug in details'</strong> and 
checking if there are at least 5 plugins with the 'plug-in Id' starting with <strong>'com.python.pydev'</strong> and at least other 5 starting with 
<strong>'org.python.pydev'</strong> (and check if they have the version you got).
</p>

<h3>Uninstalling</h3>
<p>
If at any time you wish to stop using the Pydev extensions plugin (or any other Eclipse plugin), you can disable it by going to the menu 
<strong>'help > software updates > manage configuration'</strong>, selecting the plugin and clicking 'disable', then, you have to restart Eclipse,
go to the same place again and then click on 'remove' (note that you have a button in the menu that enables you to see the 'disabled' features.
