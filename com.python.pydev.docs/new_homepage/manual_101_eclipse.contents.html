<h3>Configuring Eclipse to suit your needs</h3>

<p>
	Well, Eclipse has lots of things you can configure, and below are some things that really make a difference...<br/>
	-- actually, there is only 1 tip currently, but I intend to make it grow with the questions I receive about it, now 
	that I have a good place to put those ;-)
</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Configuring auto-refresh</strong>: Eclipse by default (at least on 3.1) does not refresh
			things automatically, so, if you make changes outside of the workspace, you will not see the changes
			until you refresh it (F5 on the navigator). However, you can change the default setting and ask Eclipse
			to refresh automatically.<br/><br/>
			To set auto-refresh, go to <strong>window > preferences > general > workspace</strong> and check the
			<strong>refresh automatically</strong> check-box.
	    </li>
	</ul>
