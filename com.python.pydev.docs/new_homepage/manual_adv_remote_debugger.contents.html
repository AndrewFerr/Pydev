	<h3>Remote Debugger</h3>
	<p>	
		In Pydev Extensions you can debug a remote program (a file that is not launched from within Eclipse). 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The steps to debug an external program are:
		<ul>
			<li>Start the remote debugger server (in Pydev Extensions)</li>
			<li>Go to the debug perspective</li>
			<li>Start the external program with the file 'pydevd.py' in its pythonpath</li>
			<li>Call pydevd.settrace()</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		Let's see a simple 'step-by-step' example on how this works:
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>1. Start the remote debugger server</strong>: To start the remote debugger server, you have to click the 
		green button pointed by '1' in the image below. After doing that, it will show a message in the console (indicated by '2') to
		confirm that the server is listening for incoming connections.

	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>2. Go to the debug perspective</strong>: This is needed because it has no actual 'signal' that it reached a breakpoint when
		doing remote debugging. So, if you already have it open, just cicle to it with <strong>Ctrl+F8</strong>. Otherwise, go to the menu:
		window > Open Perspective > Other > Debug.
	</p>
	<p>
		Note that there should appear a process named 'Debug Server' in the debug view.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>3. Make sure pydevd.py is in your pythonpath</strong>: This file is included in the org.python.pydev.debug plugin. So,
		you'll have to add it to the pythonpath. It's exact location will depend upon the eclipse location and the plugin version, being
		something like: eclipse/plugins/org.python.pydev.debug_x.x.x/pysrc/pydevd.py (so, the container folder must be in your pythonpath).
		If you choose to execute it from another machine, you need to copy all the files within that folder to the
		target machine in order to be able to debug it.
	</p>	
	<p>
		<strong>4. Call pydevd.settrace()</strong>: Now that the pydevd.py module is already on your pythonpath, you can use the 
		template provided: 'pydevd' to make the call: import pydevd;pydevd.settrace(). When that call is reached, it will automatically 
		suspend the execution and show the debugger (in Pydev Extensions).
	</p>

<h3>Important Notes</h3>
	<p>
		<strong>NOTE 1</strong>: the settrace() function can have an optional parameter to specify the host where the remote
		debugger is listening. E.g.: pydevd.settrace('10.0.0.1')
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>NOTE 2</strong>: You can have the running program in one machine and Pydev Extensions on another machine,
		but there is currently one limitation to that approach:<br/><br/>
		When a breakpoint is resolved to know if we should suspend execution, it checks it in a 'file-system dependent way',
		so, if you have set breakpoints, they are probably not going to have any effect if the modules actually map to different
		files. There are already plans to identify the breakpoints with the name of the module, and not the actual file when
		doing remote debugging, but for now this is a 'known limitation' (the python modules must map to the same files on both
		machines).<br/><br/>
		There are already plans to overcome this limitation, but the roadmap is not fixed (the roadmap will be traced depending
		on the input of the users that licensed Pydev Extensions).
