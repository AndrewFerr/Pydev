<p>Ok, now that your interpreter is configured, it is time to <strong>create a project</strong>. After opening Eclipse, go to the menu:
file > new > project > Pydev > Pydev project. You should see the screen below:
</p><br/>


<p align="center"><IMG src="images/new_project.png" border="1"/></p>
<p align="center">New Project Image</p><br/>

<p>In this screen, you have to decide the project name, its location and its type. Also, it will present an option saying 
'Create default 'src' folder and add it to the pythonpath'. If you don't leave that option checked, you'll have to create
the source folder(s) yourself after the project is created.
</p><br/>

<p>You may finish in this screen or go to the next, where you will be asked which projects are referenced from this one. This is
very important so that code completion works correctly. Also, the 'reference' is only one level deep. i.e. If you have
a project A which depends on B, which in turn depends on C, you will have to make a reference from A to B and from A to C.
It works basically getting the paths from the referenced projects and adding it to the PYTHONPATH for the project you're creating.
