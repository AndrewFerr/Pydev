After installing it, the first thing you must do is configure the <strong>python and/or jython interpreter</strong>. To configure the interpreter:

<ul>
<li>1. Go to: window > preferences > pydev > Interpreter - (Jython/Python).
</li><li>2. Choose the interpreter you have installed in your computer (such as python.exe or jython.jar)
</li>
</ul>

<p>After those steps, you should have a screen as presented below:</p><br/>

<strong>How to check if the information was correctly gotten:</strong> <br/><br/>

Make sure that you have lots of <strong>'Forced builtin libs'</strong> and some <strong>'System libs'.</strong> <br/><br/> 

The Forced builtin libs are the libraries that are built-in the interpreter, such as <strong>__builtin__, sha, etc.</strong>
For python, you should have about 50 libs and for jython about 30 libs. <br/><br/>

Additionally, you may add other libraries that you want to treat as 
builtins, such as <strong>os, wxPython, OpenGL, etc.</strong> This is very important, because Pydev works on the java side only with static information, but 
some modules don't have much information when analyzed statically, so, Pydev creates a shell to get information on those. Another important
thing is that they <strong>must be on your system pythonpath</strong> (otherwise, the shell will be unable to get that information). <br/><br/>


<strong>What if it is not correct?</strong> <br/><br/>

The most commom error is having spaces in the Eclipse installation. If you do have spaces in your Eclipse installation, you must remove the interpreter, 
close Eclipse, move it to a new folder without spaces, restart it and follow the steps above again.<br/><br/>

The information on your projects will not be lost, as this is not stored with the eclipse installation -- 
unless you specifically pointed that location for Eclipse, in which case you must move only the 
Eclipse files, and not the .metadata folder or any of your project folders.
