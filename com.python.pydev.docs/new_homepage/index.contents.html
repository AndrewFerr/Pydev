<p>'Pydev Extensions' is a plugin allows Python editing in Eclipse. 
It works with <a class="a_link" href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> and the
<a class="a_link" href="http://pydev.sf.net">Pydev "Open Source"</a> version, 
and adds features such as:</p>
<ul>
<li >Context-Insensitive code completion with auto-import
</li><li >Builtin code analysis, acting as a PyLint replacement (but much faster)
</li><li >Quick-Fix for undefined tokens (suggesting auto-imports) found in code analysis
</li><li >Quick-Fix to ignore other error messages
</li><li >Find definition replacement for Bycicle Repair Man
</li><li >Debug server (to allow debugging scripts not lauched from within Eclipse)
</li><li >Keywords presented as auto-completions as you type
</li>
</ul>
<p>The complete feature list may be found <a class="a_link" href="features.html">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>You can <a class="a_link" href="download.html">download</a> the plugin and evaluate it with full functionalities 
for one month without requiring a license. </strong>
The only difference between the licensed and the unlicensed version is that you'll get a message every 30 minutes 
saying that it is an unlicensed version (you have to license it to remove that message).</p>
