<p>'Pydev Extensions' is a plugin that allows Python editing in Eclipse. 
It works with <a class="a_link" href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> and the
<a class="a_link" href="http://pydev.sf.net">Pydev "Open Source"</a> version. You can check 
some of its features below.</p>



<h3>News</h3>

	<ul>
		<li><h4>Release 1.2.0 <IMG src="images/new.png" border="0" /></h4></li>
		<ul>
			<li>This is the first version supporting <strong>Eclipse 3.2</strong>. 
			</li>
			<li><a href="manual_adv_interactive_console.html">Interactive console</a>: content is now changed so that blocks are closed with the interactive interpreter 'rules' (so that you don't have invalid syntax errors when passing code-blocks to the interactive console).
			</li>
			<li>An action was added to the menu so that you can use the <a href="manual_adv_open_decl_quick.html">Open Declaration Quick-outline</a> without needing focus on the pydev editor.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<br/>
		<li>Two <strong>screencasts</strong> demonstrating pydev and pydev extensions have been created. They are hosted at <a href="http://showmedo.com/videos/series?name=PyDevEclipseList">ShowMeDo.com</a>.</li>

<p><strong>You can <a class="a_link" href="download.html">download</a> the plugin and evaluate it with full functionalities 
for 30 days without requiring a license. </strong>
The only difference between the licensed and the unlicensed version is that you'll get a message first at 30 mins and then after each 2 hours
saying that it is an unlicensed version (you have to license it to remove that message).</p>

    developping software is half linked to the language, half to the

    With Pydev, I've got everything."</p>

"PyDev is a core tool in our development process, and is a major reason
why Python has become viable for us as a production language.  I look
forward to each new release of PyDev as it is continually evolving into
a more and more powerful development environment.  With the addition of
PyDev Extensions, the potential for future improvements is exciting!"
