<p>'Pydev Extensions' is a plugin that allows Python editing in Eclipse. 
It works with <a class="a_link" href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> and the
<a class="a_link" href="http://pydev.sf.net">Pydev "Open Source"</a> version. See some of its features below</p>

<h3>Release Changes</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><h4>Release 1.3.2 <IMG src="images/new.png" border="0" /></h4></li>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Fix:</strong> The vmargs in the interactive console are now only really passed to the jython process</li>
			<li><strong>Fix:</strong> Rename refactoring was not getting some references that mapped to imports initially (and not directly to classes or functions)</li>
			<li><strong>Fix:</strong> Mark Occurrences marks correctly the keyword parameters in referencing calls</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>

<h3>Previous Release Changes</h3>
	<ul>
				
		<li><h4>Release 1.3.1</h4></li>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Interactive Console</strong>: jython process can receive vmargs (configured in the preferences page)</li>
			<li><strong>Code-Completion</strong>: auto-import completions will not be brought for tokens in the current module</li>
			<li><strong>Code-Completion</strong>: auto-import inserted as last import in imports list (so, __future__ imports will remain in the 1st position)</li>
			<li><strong>Code-Analysis</strong>: Only adds unused parameters in methods that have some statement that is not a 'pass' or string</li>
			<li><strong>Fix: Find Occurrences</strong>: will not 'overlap' occurrences anymore</li>
			<li><strong>Fix: Code-Analysis</strong>: deep attribute access after finding __getattr__ does not signal unresolved import errors anymore</li>
		</ul>
	
		
		
		<li><h4>Release 1.3.0</h4></li>
		<ul>
		<li><strong>Find References</strong>: Ctrl+Shift+G can be used to find the references to the selected token in the editor</li>
		<li><strong>Fix: Code-analysis</strong>: Fixed false positive for statement with no effect</li>
		</ul>

		<li><h4>Release 1.2.8</h4></li>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Code-analysis</strong>: when a compare statement is found out of a test scope, that's reported as a warning</li>
			<li><strong>Mark Occurrences</strong>: new option to choose whether strings and comments should be highlighted</li>
			<li><strong>Simple Completions</strong>: some keywords were removed from the default list (the 2-letter ones because they're barely worth it and those related to 'try', as there's already an assistant that creates 'try' blocks)</li>
			<li><strong>Rename refactoring / Mark Occurrences</strong>: matches in multi-line strings are now correct</li>
		</ul>
		<li><h4>Release 1.2.7</h4></li>
		<ul>
			<li>Mark occurrences and rename now will also get the tokens in comments and strings</li>

<p><strong>You can <a class="a_link" href="download.html">download</a> the plugin and evaluate it with full functionalities 
for 30 days without requiring a license. </strong>
The only difference between the licensed and the unlicensed version is that you'll get a message first at 30 mins and then after each 2 hours
saying that it is an unlicensed version (you have to license it to remove that message).</p>

"PyDev is a core tool in our development process, and is a major reason
why Python has become viable for us as a production language.  I look
forward to each new release of PyDev as it is continually evolving into
a more and more powerful development environment.  With the addition of
PyDev Extensions, the potential for future improvements is exciting!"
