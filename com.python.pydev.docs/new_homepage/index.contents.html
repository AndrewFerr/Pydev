<p>'Pydev Extensions' is a plugin that allows Python editing in Eclipse. 
It works with <a class="a_link" href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> and the
<a class="a_link" href="http://pydev.sf.net">Pydev "Open Source"</a> version. You can check 
some of its features below.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: This is not the complete list of features. Check the <a class="a_link" href="manual.html">manual</a> for that.</p>
<br/>
<p><strong>You can <a class="a_link" href="download.html">download</a> the plugin and evaluate it with full functionalities 
for 30 days without requiring a license. </strong>
The only difference between the licensed and the unlicensed version is that you'll get a message first at 30 mins and then after each 2 hours
saying that it is an unlicensed version (you have to license it to remove that message).</p>

    developping software is half linked to the language, half to the
    programming tools.
    
    With Pydev, I've got everything."</p>

"PyDev is a core tool in our development process, and is a major reason
why Python has become viable for us as a production language.  I look
forward to each new release of PyDev as it is continually evolving into
a more and more powerful development environment.  With the addition of
PyDev Extensions, the potential for future improvements is exciting!"
