<p>'Pydev Extensions' is a plugin that allows Python editing in Eclipse. 
It works with <a class="a_link" href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> and the
<a class="a_link" href="http://pydev.sf.net">Pydev "Open Source"</a> version. You can check 
some of its features below.</p>



<h3>News</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><h4>Release 1.2.8 <IMG src="images/new.png" border="0" /></h4></li>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Code-analysis</strong>: when a compare statement is found out of a test scope, that's reported as a warning</li>
			<li><strong>Mark Occurrences</strong>: new option to choose whether strings and comments should be highlighted</li>
			<li><strong>Simple Completions</strong>: some keywords were removed from the default list (the 2-letter ones because they're barely worth it and those related to 'try', as there's already an assistant that creates 'try' blocks)</li>
			<li><strong>Rename refactoring / Mark Occurrences</strong>: matches in multi-line strings are now correct</li>
		</ul>
		<li><h4>Release 1.2.7</h4></li>
		<ul>

			<ul>
				<li>Keybinding: <strong>Alt+Shift+R</strong></li>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: This is not the complete list of features. Check the <a class="a_link" href="manual_adv_features.html">Features Matrix</a> for that.</p>
<br/>
<p><strong>You can <a class="a_link" href="download.html">download</a> the plugin and evaluate it with full functionalities 
for 30 days without requiring a license. </strong>
The only difference between the licensed and the unlicensed version is that you'll get a message first at 30 mins and then after each 2 hours
saying that it is an unlicensed version (you have to license it to remove that message).</p>

"PyDev is a core tool in our development process, and is a major reason
why Python has become viable for us as a production language.  I look
forward to each new release of PyDev as it is continually evolving into
a more and more powerful development environment.  With the addition of
PyDev Extensions, the potential for future improvements is exciting!"
