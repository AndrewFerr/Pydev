<p>'Pydev Extensions' is a plugin that allows Python editing in Eclipse. 
It works with <a class="a_link" href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> and the
<a class="a_link" href="http://pydev.sf.net">Pydev "Open Source"</a> version, 
and has features such as:</p>
<ul>
<li >Code completion with auto-import
</li><li >Code analysis (PyLint replacement, but much faster)
</li><li >Quick-Fix for problems found in code analysis
</li><li >Go to definition (Bycicle Repair Man replacement, but much more reliable)
</li><li >Debug server (allows debugging scripts not lauched from within Eclipse)
</li><li >Keywords presented as auto-completions as you type
</li><li >Quick-outline
</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: This is not the complete list of features. Check the <a class="a_link" href="manual.html">manual</a> for that.</p>
<br/>
<p><strong>You can <a class="a_link" href="download.html">download</a> the plugin and evaluate it with full functionalities 
for 30 days without requiring a license. </strong>
The only difference between the licensed and the unlicensed version is that you'll get a message every 30 minutes 
saying that it is an unlicensed version (you have to license it to remove that message).</p>
