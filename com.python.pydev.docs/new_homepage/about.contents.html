	<strong>So, why was 'Pydev Extensions' created?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Well, Pydev Extensions was created with the idea of making a better environment to the current 
	state of python programming. <br/><br/>
	
	It is not Open Source, but its price should be accessible to most users of Pydev. Also, it
	was created with the idea of 'adding value' to the current 'Open Source' version, and not replacing it.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
	<strong>And what will happen to the Pydev 'Open Source' version?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Keeping the Pydev 'Open Source' version 'open source' is a priority. There are no plans to stop or fork its development.
	Currently, the plans around are the ones to pass technology from the Pydev Extensions to Pydev 'Open Source' from time-to-time,
	altough it is still not very clear how will that be done, as that will depend a lot on how things go with the
	Pydev Extensions version.
