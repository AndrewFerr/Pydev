	<strong>So, why was 'Pydev Extensions' created?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Well, Pydev Extensions was created with the idea of making a better environment to the current 
	state of python programming. It was created as a commercial product because we believe can offer much better
	support this way. Also, it is not Open Source, but we believe its price is accessible to most users of Pydev. 
	It was created to 'add value' to the current 'Open Source' version, and not to replace it.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
	<strong>And what will happen to the Pydev 'Open Source' version?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	We'll strive to keep the Pydev 'Open Source' version, always open source. We do not have any plans to stop or fork its development,
	and we plan to enhance and support it so that it can be used as a stand-alone plugin. 
	In fact, there are plans to pass technology from the Pydev Extensions to Pydev 'Open Source' from time-to-time.
