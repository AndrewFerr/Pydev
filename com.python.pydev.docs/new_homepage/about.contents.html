	<strong>Why was 'Pydev Extensions' created?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Pydev Extensions was created with the idea of making a better environment to the current 
	state of python programming. <br/><br/>
	
	It is not Open Source, because I believe that in that way I will be able to provide better support for it. Also, it 
	was created to be a 'professional version' of Pydev -- I know it is (currently) priced around the 'personal' 
	version of other commercial IDEs, but, don't be fooled by that, it can surely match the best IDEs around 
	(but please, don't take my word	for it... go check each version and take your own conclusions).
</p>
<br/>
<p>
	<strong>What will happen to the Pydev 'Open Source' version?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Pydev Extensions was created with the idea of 'adding value' to the current 'Open Source' version, and not replacing it,
	thus, keeping the Pydev 'Open Source' version 'open source' is a priority. 
<br/>
<br/>
	
	Currently, there are plans to pass technology from the Pydev Extensions to the 'Open Source' version from time-to-time,
	altough it is still not very clear how will that be done, as that will depend a lot on how things go with the
	Pydev Extensions version.
