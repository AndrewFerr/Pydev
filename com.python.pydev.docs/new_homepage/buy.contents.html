<p><strong>Paypal</strong></p>
<p>
The current payment system uses paypal. It accepts credit-cards and can make your payments
even easier if you already have a paypal account.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
Currently it is our only way of payment. We're already seeking other payment options
to enable those that don't have access to paypal to get Pydev Extensions, but there are 
currently no previsions on when will another option be available.
