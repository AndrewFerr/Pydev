<p><strong>Paypal</strong></p>
<p>
The current payment system uses paypal. It accepts credit-cards and can make your payments
even easier if you already have a paypal account.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
Currently it is our only way of payment, and we're already seeking other payment options
to enable those that don't have access to paypal to get Pydev Extensions.
