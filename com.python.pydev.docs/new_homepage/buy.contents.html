<h3>How does it come and how much does it cost?</h3>
<p>
Pydev Extensions licenses are sold either on a <strong>per-developer</strong> 
(it is valid for a single developer to use on any number of machines),
or on a <strong>multi-developer</strong> basis (it may be installed 
only on a fixed number of machines, but can be used by any number of developers).
</p>
<p>
Pydev Extensions has a fixed price of $35 (US Dollars), but discounts are available when buying more than 10 licenses.
</p>

<p><strong>Paypal</strong></p>
<p>
The current payment system uses paypal. It accepts credit-cards and can make your payments
even easier if you already have a paypal account.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
Currently it is our only way of payment. We're already seeking other payment options
to enable those that don't have access to paypal to get Pydev Extensions, but there are 
currently no previsions on when will another option be available.
