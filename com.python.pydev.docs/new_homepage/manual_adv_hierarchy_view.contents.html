	<h3>Hierachy View</h3>
	<p>
		In Pydev Extensions, you can use <strong>F4</strong> to open the hierarchy view for you while over some class declaration.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Hierarchy View allows you to check a class hierarchy, seeing the relations as well as methods and attributes for all the classes
		in the hierarchy.
	</p>

			Hierachy View<br/><br/>
		</p>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		After opening the hierarchy view, you can:
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Single-click</strong> a class: will show you the class methods
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Double-click</strong> a class, method or attribute: will open that declaration in the editor.
			</li>
			<li><strong>Zoom</strong>: Right-Click the view and move your mouse left/right</li>
			<li><strong>Pan</strong>: Lef-Click the view and move your mouse as you wish</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<strong>NOTE</strong>: this feature is currently in a <strong>beta</strong> state: it will only bring you subclasses that are
		in the same project of the class of interest and subclasses are not 'double-checked', meaning that it may bring subclasses
		that are actually the subclass of another class with the same name of the class you're looking for.
