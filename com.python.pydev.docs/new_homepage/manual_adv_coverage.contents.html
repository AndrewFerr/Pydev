<strong>Code coverage!</strong><br/>
<br/>
The data gathered for code coverage is obtained by a module distributed along with PyDev, 
based on the <a href="http://www.ravenbrook.com/project/p4dti/master/test/"> Perforce Defect Tracking Integration Project </a>
(actually, it was just slightly modified so that the output and input could be given in other ways).
<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Code coverage provides the following features:</strong><br/>
<br/>
<strong>In the navigator:</strong><br/>
<ul>
<li>run a file with code coverage recording (right click on python file)</li>
<li>run multiple files with code coverage recording (right click on folder)</li>
</ul>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<strong>In the code coverage contributed view:</strong><br/>
<ul>
<li>clean the code coverage information</li>
<li>refresh the code coverage information</li>
<li>choose directory to see code coverage information</li>
<li>See coverage information for a file or folder + subfolders</li>
<li>Double clicking from the coverage dir indicates the lines that were not executed as errors.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<strong> Usage:</strong><br/>
<br/>
Basically, you do some runs with the code coverage run, then you choose a dir from where you want coverage information and
can browse it as much as you want (results for the file or folder + subfolders always on the left).<br/>
<br/>
If you want to clear all the runs info, just click on clear on the view (this will not refresh the info already gotten).<br/>
<br/>
Now, if you do some more runs and want to refresh it, just call refresh.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Note:</strong> when the view is closed, the information does not reappear. However, it is not lost. You just have
to choose the folder again (the information is only lost if you click on Clear).
