	<h3>Interactive Console</h3>
	<p>
		Pydev Extensions add some features to the <a href="http://pydev.sourceforge.net/console.html">open source interactive interpreter</a>:
		<br/>
		<br/>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<strong>Ctrl+Alt+Enter</strong> (while in the Pydev editor) can be used
		to open a console if there's no open console. With an open console, <strong>Ctrl+Alt+Enter</strong>
		will make an execfile of the current editor in the console, so that its symbols are available for further experimentation.
		<br/>
		<br/>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<strong>Code-completion with auto-import</strong>: In the console, Pydev Extensions will add 
		context-insensitive completions, in the same way they're added in the editor, so, when it's finished, a 
		"from mod import ChosenClass" will be added and evaluated, and the current
		line will be kept for further typing.  
		<br/>
		<br/>
	</p>
	<p>
		For more info on context-insensitive completions see: <a href="manual_adv_complnoctx.html">Context-insensitive completions</a>
