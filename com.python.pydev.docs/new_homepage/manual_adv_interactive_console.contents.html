	<h3>Interactive Console</h3>
	<p>
		In Pydev Extensions, you can use <strong>Ctrl+Enter</strong> to open a console for you, and you can use the editor to 
		pass commands to the opened console.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The Pydev editor enables you to pass commands directly from the editor to the console, either evaluating on
		each new line, or only on request for a given selected code. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Alternatively you may code directly in the Console if you want.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		You may also choose some 'common' operations you want it to execute each time you create a new shell.
