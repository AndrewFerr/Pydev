Hi, my name is Fabio and I'll show you how to get configure pydev correctly to get up and running 
with it -- I'll assume you already have Eclipse and pydev installed.

Now, the first thing you need to do is set up a python interpreter.

For that you have to go to the window > preferences menu and choose the Pydev > Interpreter:Python option
....

Ok, and that's it. In this 'show me do' I've demonstrated how to set up the pydev environment 
so that you can use code-completion without any problems. Most of what I passed -- with instructions 
on how to install pydev and its features can be found at:
