Hi, my name is Fabio and I'm going to show
you some of the things you're able to do
with pydev extensions, such as the
ways you can navigate through the source
code or make good use of its code-completion
capabilities and a little bit about its code-analysis

...

So, that's it, I hope you enjoyed it. You can check
the help ... to know where you can get more info
about it.

- some navigation utilities:
  * jump up/down in functions / classes
  * quick outline
  * global token browser

- go to definition

- code-completion
  * Keywords completion
  * auto-import

- code-analysis and quick-fixes
