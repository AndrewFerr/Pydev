Ok, this is an introduction on how to configure pydev to work with turbogears.

I still haven't used turbogears myself, so, in the end, this might be interesting for other users that are starting in the turbogears world themselves ;-)

1st step: getting turbogears 

OK: downloaded version 0.8.9, which is the latest release

2nd step: installing it

Running setup.py install did some nice things for me... it downloaded setuptools automatically (as it was a pre-requisite) and then proceeded getting other dependencies (egg files) and installed all those without further problems (yeap, many dependencies there).

Now, I still don't have docutils (which it says will make it more 'fun') nor a database, so, I'll get it before I proceed.

It says to use easy_install to get docutils, but it needs some search to know exactly what it means (turns out to be a script installed in my computer at C:\bin\Python24\Scripts\easy_install.exe)

Turns out it didn't do it's job:

[C:\bin]c:\bin\Python24\Scripts\easy_install.exe docutils

Searching for docutils
Reading http://www.python.org/pypi/docutils/
Reading http://docutils.sourceforge.net/
Best match: docutils 0.4
Downloading http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/docutils/docutils-0.4.tar.gz?download
Requesting redirect to (randomly selected) 'mesh' mirror
error: No META HTTP-EQUIV="refresh" found in Sourceforge page at http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/
docutils/docutils-0.4.tar.gz?use_mirror=mesh

So, I went on to get it myself and then proceeded to get pysqlite (http://pysqlite.org).

So, now on to see how pydev looks... First, my interpreter configuration has become obsolete, so, all those libraries that were added later are not there... So, I just remove the interpreter and add it again (so, it should get all those new libraries -- version 1.2.0 of pydev and earlier had a 'cache' bug, so, you'd need to remove the interpreter, press apply and only after it proceed to add the interpreter again).

So, just to make sure pysqlite is there:
from pysqlite2 import dbapi2 as sqlite
con = sqlite.connect("mydb") 
print con

Ok, connection there, and a mydb file created, so, everything seems fine.

I decided to go with the 20 minute-flash that turbogears has there... Ok, it starts creating a project with tg_admin quickstart. So, I decided to create a new pydev project from eclipse before and placed it at d:\turbogears, and ran tg_admin quickstart from within that directory to get started.
