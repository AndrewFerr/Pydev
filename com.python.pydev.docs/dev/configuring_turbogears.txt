Ok, this is an introduction on how to configure pydev to work with turbogears.

I still haven't used turbogears myself, so, in the end, this might be interesting for other users that are starting in the turbogears world themselves ;-)

1st step: getting turbogears 

OK: downloaded version 0.8.9, which is the latest release

2nd step: installing it

Running setup.py install did some nice things for me... it downloaded setuptools automatically (as it was a pre-requisite) and then proceeded getting other dependencies (egg files) and installed all those without further problems (yeap, many dependencies there).

Now, I still don't have docutils (which it says will make it more 'fun') nor a database, so, I'll get it before I proceed.

It says to use easy_install to get docutils, but it needs some search to know exactly what it means (turns out to be a script installed in my computer at C:\bin\Python24\Scripts\easy_install.exe)

Turns out it didn't do it's job:

[C:\bin]c:\bin\Python24\Scripts\easy_install.exe docutils

Searching for docutils
Reading http://www.python.org/pypi/docutils/
Reading http://docutils.sourceforge.net/
Best match: docutils 0.4
Downloading http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/docutils/docutils-0.4.tar.gz?download
Requesting redirect to (randomly selected) 'mesh' mirror
error: No META HTTP-EQUIV="refresh" found in Sourceforge page at http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/
docutils/docutils-0.4.tar.gz?use_mirror=mesh

So, I went on to get it myself and then proceeded to get sqllite (http://pysqlite.org and http://sqlite.org)
