<h2>Pydev editor preferences</h2>
<p><img src="images/ed_prefs.gif" width="599" height="326"></p>
<p><strong>Substitute spaces for tabs</strong>: whether editor should insert spaces when you hit a tab. </p>
<p><strong>Assume tab spacing when files contain tabs?</strong>: you'll like this preference if you swing both ways, and mix &amp; match tabs and spaces, When this pref is on, if the file is tab-indented editor will do the right thing and leave your tabs alone. </p>
<p><strong>Tab length</strong>: in inches </p>
<p><strong>Colors</strong>: are self-explanatary (black, purple, olive-green, dark-red). Not a very attractive scheme, but you get used to it. </p>
