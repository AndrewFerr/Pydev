<h2>Editor</h2>
<p>Editor works as you'd expect. You get </p>
<ul>
  <li>syntax highlighting</li>
  <li>outline view with imports/functions/classes </li>
  <li>the parser errors get marked. The text next to the parser errors is a bit cryptic, but hey, at least you know where the error is.</li>
  <li>Editor tries to deal with tabs/spaces sensibly. You can set the preference to your preferred coding style.</li>
  <li>Navigation: keyboard shortcuts to previous/next function</li>
  <li>comment/uncomment commands</li>
  <li> hyperlinks over functions//import :</li>
</ul>
<p>If you press CTRL while mousing over function &amp; import names you'll get a hyperlink to their definition. The hyperlinking only works for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>functions defined in the same file</li>
  <li>imports that are on your import path. The import path includes python.exe/Lib, if you've defined python executable in your pydev:debug preferences.</li>
</ul>
