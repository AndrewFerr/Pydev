<h2>Pydev manual</h2>
<p>Pydev is a Python development environment for Eclipse. It is an open-source effort, hosted at  <a href="http://pydev.sourceforge.net/">http://pydev.sourceforge.net/</a>. See the website for the up-to-date development information.</p>
<p>Pydev consists of two main components, the editor and the debugger. The editor is stable, and provides the following features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>syntax highlighting</li>
  <li>syntax analysis, first synax error gets marked</li>
  <li>works with tabs or spaces. </li>
  <li>outline view that shows functions, imports, classes</li>
  <li>limited hyperlinks: by pressing ctrl key you can jump to functons defined inside the same file.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the first public release of the debugger, so its stability is unknown. The debugger provider the following features: </p>
<ul>
  <li>fully integrated into Eclipse's debugging framework.</li>
  <li>execution control: you can set breakpoints, step in/out/over</li>
  <li>supports python threads.</li>
  <li>variables/stack are there, just like other IDE's </li>
  <li>console traces are hyperlinked to files. Even files outside of workspace can be opened through hyperlinks. </li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the advanced Eclipse features are not there: conditional breakpoints, code execution. </p>
