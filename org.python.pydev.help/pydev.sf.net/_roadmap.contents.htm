<H3>This are the features I am planning to have implemented... </H3>

<P>The roadmap is just what I'm thinking, but it might go different if someone decides to contribute something.</P>
<strong><P>Target for 1.0.</P></strong>

Fix the bugs!


<strong><P>After 1.0</P></strong>
</LI><LI>Make some content assistants to help in TDD (aka Java ones).
</LI><LI>Quick outline (like java does - it seems that eclipse is working on support for plugins)
</LI><LI>Package explorer (probably similar to java)
</LI><LI>Interactive shell (probably with IPython)
</LI><LI>Wizards (create class / module)
</LI><LI>Improve the pyunit integration. 
</LI><LI>Jython integration. 
</LI>

<H3>You'd like to give it a try?</H3>

<P>You can download the latest source 
		from sourceforge. </P>

<P>To compile, you need to set the following preferences:</P>

<P>'Plug-In Development: Java Build Path Control: Use classpath containers' to true</P>

<P>'Plug-In Development: Target Platform' select "this application" and enable all plugins.</P>

<P>Most of the code is well-documented in javadoc. I try 
	to cc every answer to a coding question to pydev-code, so you can look there for 
	hints too. That's it. If you have not developed Eclipse plugins before, I 
	recommend reading the online documentation and trying out a sample plugin. 
	Doing some prep work before jumping in will really pay off.</P>

<STRONG>Then, it is all up to you.</STRONG>
