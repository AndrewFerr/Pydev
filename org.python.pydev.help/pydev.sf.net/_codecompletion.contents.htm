<H3>Code Completion</H3>

<br>
<strong> Notes for release 0.9.4 </strong>

<p>
Code completion is finished for now (and it is already pretty complete). Only bug-fixes until 1.0!
</p>

<br>
<strong> Now, how to use it:</strong><br><br>

First thing you have to do is enabling it. To do it, you have to go to <br><br>
Window->preferences->PyDev->Code Completion<br><br>
The screen below should show. Check the Use Code completion (you probably also want to check
Autocomplete on '.').

After setting the preferences, you have to set the PYTHONPATH you want to use for a certain project.
