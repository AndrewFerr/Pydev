<fieldset>
<legend>About</legend>
<p>Pydev is a project to create a complete python development environment for eclipse: syntax highlighting,
outline view, code navigation, debugger integration. The current release is 0.6. Both editor and debugger require Java 1.4.x. and Eclipse 3.0. If you are running Eclipse 2.1.x, use 0.4.2. Pydev consists of 3 plugins:</p>
<p><b><a href="snap.gif">Editor</a></b> (org.python.pydev): </p>
<li>syntax highlighting
<li>the parser errors marked in the task list
<li>outline view with imports/functions/classes
<li>tabs/spaces preference.</li>
<li>Navigation: keyboard shortcuts to previous/next function</li>
<li>comment/uncomment commands (on the popup menu) </li>
<li> hyperlinks over functions//import statements</li>
<li>code folding </li>
<li>refactoring (Bicycle Repair Man integration</li>
<li>code completion</li>
<p><b><a href="images/debugger.gif">Debugger</a></b> (org.python.pydev.debug)</p>

<p>Pydev is an open-source project, hosted at <a href='http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/pydev/'>http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/pydev/</a>.
You can download the releases from there, or from an Eclipse update site <a href="http://pydev.sf.net/updates/">http://pydev.sf.net/updates/</a>.
Developer issues are discussed at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_id=39082">pydev-code</a> mailing list. For support, try the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=293649">users</a> bulletin board. I sometimes post tidbits about the development progress in the <a href="http://blogs.osafoundation.org/atotic/cat_work_log.html">weblog</a>. 
<p>Pydev has been developed by Aleks Totic as a &quot;getting to know Eclipse&quot; project, with some wonderful help from Fabio &quot;Foldin&quot; Zadrozny.</p>

<legend><a name="debug"></a>Debugging the debugger</legend>
<p>
The current release of the debugger is of alpha quality. 
<li>I wrote the 
whole thing from scratch. 
<li>I am not very familiar with python internals.
<li>I have not used it daily
<p>These three reasons add up to something which is an alpha. For some users, it works
great, the others do not get beyond the launch. If you'd like to help me on the road to beta, please
file detailed bug reports. With your bug reports, attach the trace of the debugger.
To get the trace, you need to edit debugger source:</p>
<p>Inside eclipse/plugins/org.python.pydev.debug/pysrc/pydevd.py, change
<pre>pydevd_trace = 0</pre>
to
<pre>pydevd_trace = 2</pre>
Now, when you launch the debugger, you'll get a lot of tracing output. Attach this
to your bug reports.

<b>History</b>
In 2003, I was volunteering at OSAF. OSAF was developing Chandler in Python and wxWindows. 
I was not a great fan of wx, so I looked around for other cross-platform GUI toolkits.
That's when I discovered Eclipse and SWT, and I really liked what I saw. I am a big fan
of IDEs, ever since I used ThinkPascal to teach myself Macintosh Toolbox. Poweplant & 
CodeWarrior are still the nicest development combo I've ever used. With Eclipse, I saw
potential, Emacs for the 21st century. So I decided to see what would it take to
create a Python IDE for it.

The answer is, a lot of time. Eclipse's APIs are a bit convoluted, with intefaces,
delagates, and adapters obscuring your vision like a San Francisco fog. Thankfully, 
the source code is there representing all the knowledge. It just takes a lot of time.
O'Reilly editors, if you are reading this, I'd be very happy to help out with
"Learning Eclipse".

As an additional handicap, my last real encounter with Java was in '95, and that was
with its C security APIs. Oh, and I never really coded much in Python either.

In spite of all this, 0.4 is here, and I am happy with it. It has a debugger, 
and an editor. Both of them are not fully-featured, like its Java counterparts, 
but they are very usable for smaller projects. My interest in the project is 
starting to wane, I've done what I wanted to do, and I am ready for something new.

<b>Future</b>
My plans for the future are:
- Wrap up the production of 1.0. We are feature complete, and as soon as I
like the quality, I'll release the code under 1.0 banner.

And that's it. Over & out, off to new projects.

So if you like this tool, it'll be up to you to take it to where you want it to be.
I am always happy to discuss design, it is much less painful than coding. Here are some
of my thoughts for the future:

Editor:

Editor could use some minor polish, especially when it comes to spaces/tabs issues.
Things like smart-indent paste, multiple-space delete when i hit delete on the blank
line, etc.
The most requested feature in the editor is code completion/assist/hyperlink navigation.
All these depend on the good model of the underlying code. I am currently building the 
model myself using jython's parser. Whoever decideds to implement these should look
into using more of whatever model jython uses. I think RedRobin guy is using this
approach, and is having a lot of success.
It would be really neat if you could use Jython to run code refactoring/error
checking scripts already in common use in the Python community.
For full-featured development, editor needs to understand and deal with modules.
It needs knowledge of include paths, wizards to create new modules.

Debugger:

I am proud of this one. The debugger is written in 2 parts, java & python.
The python part is yet another implementation of a remote debugger. I really tried
to use what was out there, but none of it had functionality & documentation that
I needed. Some feature ideas are:
- extending breakpoints with watchpoints/expressions
- implementing the unimplemented container variables display (you only need python 
knowledge for this, look at pydev_vars.py).
- implementing the "change variable" API
- allowing execution inside frame context.
- remote debugging capabilities
All of these are between 1 and 3 day tasks, if you know python & eclipse.

<b>You'd like to give it a try?</b>
You can download the latest source from sourceforge. To compile, you need to set
the following preferences:
'Plug-In Development:Java Build Path Control:Use classpath containers' to true
'Plug-In Development:Target Platform' select "this application" and enable all plugins.
Most of the code is well-documented in javadoc. I try to cc every answer to a coding
question to pydev-code, so you can look there for hints too.
That's it. If you have not developed Eclipse plugins before, I recommend reading the 
online documentation and trying out a sample plugin. Doing some prep work before
jumping in will really pay off.
Then, it is all up to you. 

As for me, I have several possible projects coming up. I might do something with
Mozilla guys. I am also thinking of developing a family tree web site that my family
could use. Of course, there is no CMS system out there I am happy with, so
it'd involve writing a whole new one. Or I might do some work
with startups, or something completely different. Life is never boring. Well, coding
gets boring every once in a while, but I am just such an amateur when it comes
to many other things I'd like to do.
