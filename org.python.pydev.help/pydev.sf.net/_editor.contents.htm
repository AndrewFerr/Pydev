<h2>Pydev editor preferences</h2>

This screen provides you ways of configuring your PyDev editor to your personal preferences (thanks for the patch Scott!)

<br>
<p><img src="images/ed_prefs.png"></p>
<p><strong>Substitute spaces for tabs</strong>: whether editor should insert spaces when you hit a tab. </p>
<p><strong>Assume tab spacing when files contain tabs?</strong>: you'll like this preference if you swing both ways, and mix &amp; match tabs and spaces. When this pref is on, if the file is tab-indented editor will do the right thing and leave your tabs alone. </p>
<p><strong>Code folding</strong>: turn this off if you'd like to get back the screen real estate </p>
<p><strong>Tab length</strong>: in inches </p>
<p><strong>Colors</strong>: Allows you to configure the colors you want for your syntax highlighting and other editor colors.</p>

I think the others are self-explanatory, but if you don't understand, you can ask in the user forum!
