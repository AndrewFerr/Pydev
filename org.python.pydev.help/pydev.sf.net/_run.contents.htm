When Running a subset you can choose between <strong>running each file on a separate shell </strong>(and therefore with a
different output) or <strong>running each one from a script </strong>(and the script will be responsible for
choosing the files to be run (it will receive the directory as an argument). Running with the script will make
a single output for all the files. An example script is provided and is be given as the default script.<br><br>
