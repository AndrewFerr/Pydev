<h3>Sponsoring</h3>

Well, PyDev is provided as an Open Source Project, but without some kind of support, it is really hard to keep any
project going, so, if you really like it and use it, you can help by 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/donate/index.php?group_id=85796">donating</a> or even 
<strong>becoming an official sponsor</strong> for the project. <strong>Contact me 
if you have interest</strong> and want to know how the sponsoring program works (you can contact me through my user in sourceforge:
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/users/fabioz/">fabioz</a>).

<h3>PyDev Sponsors</h3>

<p/>
- 
<a href="http://www.esss.com.br"><img alt="" src="images/logo_esss2.gif" BORDER="1" /></a>
 This is my current employer, and it sponsors PyDev by letting me work on PyDev in some of my work-hours (not 
that many companies do that nowadays).
<a href="http://www.esss.com.br">ESSS: Engineering Simulation and Scientific Software</a> is a company that 
develops scientific software. It creates customized software (scientific visualization and simulation)
for many engineering purposes (do I have to say we use Python?), and makes consulting in 
engineering-related fields.

<p/>
- Everyone that <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/project_donations.php?group_id=85796"> donates </a> at paypal!

<h3>PyDev "Technical" Sponsors</h3>

<p/>
- <a href="http://sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a>: Provides cvs, bug-reporting, and other hosting-related things. 
It also sponsors many other open-source projects (they gain their part when someone donates, so, if you donate, 
you also support it).

<p/>
- <a href="http://paypal.com">Paypal</a> for giving some way to people to donate to the project (they also make money when
you donate through them).

<p/>
- <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/">Google Adsense program</a> for enabling some click-based revenue for the project (AKA 
the others - makes money too).

<h3>PyDev Supporters</h3>

<p/>
- <A href="http://pydev.blogspot.com/">Fabio Zadrozny</A> (Myself): Well, I work on PyDev 
on my free time, did you know? Currently, I'm the one who keeps the project going...

<p/>
- <A href="http://blogs.osafoundation.org/atotic/cat_work_log.html">Aleks Totic</A>: He started the project, and
currently, sometimes solves some bugs found in the debugger - even tough that's starting to become rare (seems
the debugger is pretty stable hum?? ;-) )

<p/>
- Everyone that sends patches to PyDev (If you want your name here, please e-mail me, as I don't want to put your
