How do I Report a BUG?
</h3>

Well, if you don't find anything that helps you, please check if it is a known BUG, if it is not, please, report it.<br>
The place to search and report BUGS is <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=85796&atid=577329">here</a><br>
When reporting a bug, don't forget to give the following information:<br><br>
- System (e.g windows XP)<br>
- Eclipse version (e.g. 3.0.1)<br>
- PyDev version (e.g. 0.9.2)<br>
- PyDev error log (if any): go to window->show view->other->PDE Runtime->Error log.<br>
- Eclipse install location (e.g. D:\eclipse_3\302\eclipse)<br>
- Project location where the bug appears (e.g. D:\eclipse\workspace\org.python.pydev)<br>
- <br>
<br>
NOTE: the <A href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=293649">Users Forum</A> may be used for
some doubts, but if you have a bug, that's not the place to go (even though, it might be useful searching it to
see if what you have is not really a bug or if someone has already asked about it).

<strong>
- How do I configure my PYTHONPATH?
</strong><br><br>
There are 3 places where you have to go to configure the PYTHONPATH, and by doing so, 
PyLint, code completion, running and others should use this configuration.<br/><br/>

<strong>1.</strong>Go to window->preferences->pydev->Python Interpreters and 
set the python interpreter location. <br/><br/>
<IMG src="images/interpreter_conf.png" border="1" >
<br/><br/>

<strong>2.</strong>In the navigator, right click on the project root and choose 'properties'. <br/><br/>
In <b>PyDev PYTHONPATH</b>, you have to set your <b>source folders</b> (where your sources are within the project) and the 
<b>external source folders</b> (folders that are not within your eclipse environment).<br/><br/>
<IMG src="images/properties_conf.png" border="1" >
<br/><br/>

<strong>3.</strong>Also in the project properties, you have to choose the project references, so that your 
current projects gets those projects configurations in the PYTHONPATH.  <br/><br/>

<br/><br/>

<strong>
- What is that 'Forced builtin libs' in the Python Interpreters preferences?
</strong><br><br>
Well, some libraries once installed do not really show in code completion because they do
not have a corresponding module (such as __builtin__ and datetime) or they do have a 
corresponding module but it cannot be really used in code completion because most of
its information is only gotten at runtime (such as sys and os), so, in order for code completion
to get its information, you have to manually add it to those libs (and by doing so, its information
is gotten with a python shell).

<h3>
How do I configure a python shell for experimenting with Python?
</h3>
Well, for that, you have to configure an external tool.
Go to the menu->Run->External Tools and configure the location, working dir and don't forget to put the
-i argument so that you enter in interactive mode! <br/><br/>
The picture below shows what I mean...<br/><br/>

<br>
<br>
Now, the only thing missing is running it! And don't forget to add a keybinding to rerun the last executed external
tool, so that you don't have to go through the menu every time!
<br>

<h3>
Why don't I get some simple text completion in PyDev?
</h3>
We do not provide text completion ourselves in the plugin, as other plugins 
already provide this. A good suggestion is using the <A href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/lunar-eclipse/">
lunar eclipse</A> editor-enhancements plugin. It does not only provide text 
completion, but other very useful enhancements.
<br><br>



<hr/>
<h3>
The PyDev builder is taking too much of my time, what can I do about it?
</h3>
Well, if you have PyLint active, you can disable it, as it is the process that takes most time when building.<br>
Another alternative is disabling the builder altoghether. To do it you can go to window->preferences->pydev->builder 
and disable it. <br>
NOTE: Disabling the builders may have many side-effects, such as code completion not working, pylint, tasks, etc. So,
if you really want it, you can disable it, but do it with care.
<br><br>

<h3>
Why the PyDev properties do not show?
</h3>

Probably you are in the JAVA package explorer or something similar. You have to use the default navigator so
that it shows its properties.<br>
Also note that you have to open a python file with PyDev in the project before it appears in the properties too 
(the project python nature appears only after you do that).<br><br>




<hr/>

<h3>
I can see no new Python project, how am I supposed to use PyDev?
</h3>
Well, you basically have to do a simple project and use create simple file / folder to create python modules.<br>
<br>
You may also have to associate the *.py with the PyDev editor (even though that is probably automatic).<br>
Anyway, if you need it, go to window->preferences->workbench->file associations and associate *.py with PyDev.<br><br>
p.s. Don't forget to put it into both of your PYTHONPATHs (enviroment and in the project properties).
<br><br>

<h3>
How do I run a module from within eclipse using PyDev? 
</h3>
To do that, the easiest way is going to the Run menu (Run->Run As->Python). If it is not available in your current
eclipse perspective, you can enable it by going to window->customize perspective->commands and checking the "Lauch" item
(in this way, you can go only with the keyboard).<br><br>
Another way to run a module is right clicking the module in the navigator and choosing python->run (when a .py file is selected).
<br><br>

OK, I know that many features are available, but I just don't know how can I access them through my keyboard!!

Many of them can be customized in the Keybindings menu (window->preferences->workbench->keys).
