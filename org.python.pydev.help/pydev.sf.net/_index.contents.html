<h1>Intro</h1>

<p>Pydev is currently maintained by <b>Fabio Zadrozny</b> - it
has been created by <b>Aleks Totic</b> as a "getting to know
Eclipse project".</p>

<p>It's been some time since the last pydev release... This is
due to a complete rewrite of code completion, so, plans have
changed for release 1.0... It will only get to 1.0 after a stable
version of code completion is created (right now, it depends on a
Python shell that executes code for doing code completion). I
added a <a href="images/new_code_completion.png">screenshot</a>
of what I've gotten so far, so you know what to expect!</p>


<h1>Quick Summary</h1>

<p>Pydev has still not reached 1.0, but it is already <b>stable
enough</b> for python editing, with features such as:</p>

<ul class="noindent">
<li><a href="codecompletion.html">Code Completion</a>
(<b>disabled by default</b> - see notes on the preferences
page).</li>

<li><a href="refactoring.html">Refactoring</a> with <a href=
"http://bicyclerepair.sourceforge.net/">bicycle repair
man</a>.</li>

<li>Outline</li>

<li>Go to definition with <em>F3</em> (powered by <a href=
"http://bicyclerepair.sourceforge.net/">bicycle repair
man</a>)</li>

<li>Debugger</li>

<li><a href="contentassist.html">Content Assistant</a>
<em>(Ctrl+1)</em></li>

<li><a href="codecoverage.html">Code Coverage</a></li>

<li>Etc. (more details can be found at the <a href=
"Features.html">features</a> page)</li>

</ul>



<h2>Notes for release 0.8.0</h2>

<p>This release should have fixed the reported bugs on code
completion and on markers (thanks for the feedback!)<br />
 And for those of you that had problems, please check them and
see if it works!<br />
<br />
 Builders have also been added, so, now we can have <a href=
"tasks.html">TODO tasks</a> and get <a href=
"pylint.html">Pylint</a> to analyze python files.<br />
<br />
<br />
