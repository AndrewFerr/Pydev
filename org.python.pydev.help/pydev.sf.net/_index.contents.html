- 'software development' is something that really takes time, so, in short, this would help me manage / develop 
the project better, mostly because I could dedicate more time to the project if I could get some money from it .
<br/><br/>
Or you could make patches, check it (or the homepage) for bugs, or simply go to the forum and answer some questions... 
Any kind of support is appreciated.

<h2>News:</h2>

<strong>New Release: 0.9.2!!</strong><br/>


<br/>
Well, as you all know, software development is something that appears almost out-of-control at times,
so, many places had unit-tests added as I started to refactor and improve some areas, so, expect the quality to keep up,
even while new features are added! 
<br/>
<br/>

<strong>Home page update</strong> - I cleaned it up a bit, so that I don't have to duplicate information in many places (easier to mainain).<br/>
