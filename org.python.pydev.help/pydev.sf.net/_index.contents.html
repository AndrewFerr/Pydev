<h2>News:</h2>

<strong>New Release: 0.9.3!!</strong><br/>
<br/>
Wohooo!! Code completion Rules! Check it out! Many heuristics have been added to make you experience on code completion
an absolute breeze! I hope you enjoy it!
<br/>
<br/>
Aside from that, I'm currently working on giving a better support for Content Assistants (Ctrl+1), especially to
provide those that use TDD with some very nice features to create class / method... Still in beta mode, but I think
it is already useful, so, enjoy!
<br/>
<br/>
Next step in the development should be polishing its configuration, so that you don't have to specify so many
PYTHONPATHS... and voila, 1.0 reached!
<br/>
<br/>
And last, but not least... latest version of PyLint has been integrated!
