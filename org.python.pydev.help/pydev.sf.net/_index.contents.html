<h2>News:</h2>

<strong>New Release: 0.9.4!!</strong><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There are many bugs fixed for the release, and the major feature is the 
new way of configuring your ambient. Check the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> for up-to-date info on
how to do it (and do it as the first thing after installing the new PyDev version!).
<br/>
<br/>
Also, this release marks the final features for 1.0, so, what still needs to be done is polishing it just a little
bit more and fixing the bugs found.
