<p>
<STRONG>Pydev</STRONG> is a complete <a target="_blank" href="http://www.python.org">
		python</a> development environment for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.eclipse.org">
		eclipse</a> (I guess you could also call it a Python IDE).</p>

<br>
<h2>Intro</h2>

<P>
	Pydev is currently maintained by <B>Fabio Zadrozny</B> 
	 - it has been created by <B>Aleks Totic</B> as a "getting to know Eclipse project".
</P>


<p>
	It's been some time since no releases for pydev are done... This is due to a complete rewrite of code
 	completion, so, plans have changed for release 1.0... It will only get to 1.0 after a stable version of
	code completion is created (right now, it depends on a Python shell that executes code for doing code completion).
	I added a <a href="images/new_code_completion.png">screenshot</a> of what I've gotten so far, so you know
	what to expect!

</p>
<br>

<h2>Notes for release 0.8.0</h2>

<p>
	This release should have fixed the reported bugs on code completion and on markers (thanks for the feedback!)<br>
	And for those of you that had problems, please check them and see if it works!<br><br>
	Builders have also been added, so, now we can have <a href="tasks.html">TODO tasks</a> and
	get <a href="pylint.html">Pylint </a> to analyze python files.<br>
<br><br>
</p>

<h1>Quick Summary</h1> 
<P>
	Pydev has still not reached 1.0, but it is already <b>stable enough </b>for 
	python editing, with features such as:
