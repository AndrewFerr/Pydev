<h2>News:</h2>

<strong>New Release: 0.9.5</strong><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This build is mostly bug-fixes (I really recommend getting it)! 
<br/>
<br/>
<strong>NOTE</strong>: there are minor incompatibilities with the 0.9.4 pythonpath configuration
(nothing big, but the python interpreter will be lost and will have to be reconfigured).
<br/>
<br/>
Also, the final features for 1.0 are fixed, so, what still needs to be done is polishing it just a little
bit more and fixing the bugs found.
