<h2>Notes for release 0.8.0</h2>

<p>This release should have fixed the reported bugs on code
completion and on markers (thanks for the feedback!)<br />
 And for those of you that had problems, please check them and
see if it works!<br />
<br />
 Builders have also been added, so, now we can have <a href=
