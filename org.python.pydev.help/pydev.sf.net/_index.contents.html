<strong>New Release: 0.8.5!!</strong><br>
<br>
This release has as its main feature a new <a href="codecompletion.html">Code Completion</a>. 
Check more details <a href="codecompletion.html">here</a>.<br>
<br>
Other things in the release include some bugs corrected, and some patches:<br>
<li>Scott Schlesier has provided a patch to configure the editor background and color of the highlighted line. </li>
<li>Sebastian Tusk provided a patch to see watch expressions on debug. </li>
<br>
I was expecting to release it only when I finished the whole code completion stuff, but it is taking longer than I thought
for me to get there (mostly because I don't have much spare time to work on it). Anyway, first phase for it is 
completed, missing only code completion for method parameters and locals (and maybe something else I forgot
to mention). So, if anyone finds bugs, please fill a bug report!
<br><br>
Oh, there's something I have to mention... this project has received its 
<strong>first donation</strong> <br><IMG src="images/tks_smiley4.gif" border="0" > Thanks to NVision Solutions Inc.<br>
<br>
If you also want to donate, click <a href="http://sourceforge.net/donate/index.php?group_id=85796">here (paypal)</a>. And just as
a reminder... When you donate to a sourceforge project, you indirectly donate to sourceforge too (so, you donate for both
open source initiatives at once)!
