<h2>News:</h2>
<p>
<strong>New Release: 0.9.0!!</strong><br><br>
<li>
This release claims support for python 2.4 syntax (sort of - see details <a href = "version_2_4.html">here</a>). 
</li>
<li>
The new <a href="pylint.html">PyLint 0.6</a> is integrated with PyDev!!
</li>
<li>
Builders can be disabled if you want (check our <a href=faq.html>FAQ</a>).
</li>
<br>
<br>
<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> <a href="codecompletion.html">Code Completion</a> is still not finished, but for those of you using python 2.4, you
should really upgrade (because of a build error, sometimes version 0.8.5 code completion did not work well with python 2.4) 
<br>
<br>

<br>
<strong>FAQ</strong>: I added a <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> to the project, as it seems we're starting to reach an always-growing python audience.
So, don't forget to read it before asking for support or using the users forum.

Thanks to everyone that supports this project... It feels really good know that the effort to support this project is being appreciated!
<br>
<br>
If you also want to donate, click <a href="http://sourceforge.net/donate/index.php?group_id=85796">here (paypal)</a>. And just as
a reminder... When you donate to a sourceforge project, you indirectly donate to sourceforge too (so, you donate for both
open source initiatives at once)!
