</li>

<li>
Keep you 'quality standards': <a href="pylint.html">PyLint 0.6</a> is integrated with PyDev!! <br>
PyLint can help you verify your code for some 'quality standard',
and can find many errors in your program without having to run it.
</li>

<li>
Builders can be disabled if you want (check our <a href=faq.html>FAQ</a> as this can be a problem or a solution).

If you also want to donate, click <a href="http://sourceforge.net/donate/index.php?group_id=85796">here (paypal)</a>. And just as
a reminder... When you donate to a sourceforge project, you indirectly donate to sourceforge too (so, you donate for both
open source initiatives at once)!
