<h2>Pydev editor preferences</h2>
<p><img src="images/ed_prefs.png" ></p>
<p><strong>Substitute spaces for tabs</strong>: whether editor should insert spaces when you hit a tab. </p>
<p><strong>Assume tab spacing when files contain tabs?</strong>: you'll like this preference if you swing both ways, and mix &amp; match tabs and spaces, When this pref is on, if the file is tab-indented editor will do the right thing and leave your tabs alone. </p>
<p><strong>Code folding</strong>: turn this off if you'd like to get back the screen real estate </p>
<p><strong>Tab length</strong>: in inches </p>
<p><strong>Colors</strong>: are self-explanatary. The default colors have been borrowed from IDLE. </p>

I think the others are self-explanatary, but if you don't understand, you can ask in the user forum!
