<h2>What is PyDev?</h2>

PyDev is a plugin that enables users to use Eclipse for Python development. It comes with many goodies such as code completion,
syntax highlighting, syntax analysis, refactor, debug and many others. If you want more details on

<h2>New Release: 0.9.7</h2>

This build build fixes some nasty bugs from 0.9.6... it is highly recommended you install it.
(right now, everything but the <strong>debugger</strong> should work with 3.1).

<h3>Important notes</h3>

<strong>Note 2</strong>: This release only works with Eclipse 3.1 (and from now on, Eclipse 3.0.x is no longer supported).
