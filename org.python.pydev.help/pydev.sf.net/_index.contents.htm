<h3>What is PyDev?</h3>

PyDev is a plugin that enables users to use Eclipse for Python development. It comes with many goodies such as code completion,
syntax highlighting, syntax analysis, refactor, debug and many others. If you want more details on
the provided features, you can check <a href="features.html">here</a>.

<h3>New Release: 0.9.7</h3>

This build fixes some nasty bugs from 0.9.6... it is highly recommended you install it.
(right now, everything but the <strong>debugger</strong> should work with 3.1).

<h3>Important notes</h3>
<strong>Note 1</strong>: Because of some issues with Eclipse, you have to <strong>uninstall</strong> all previous PyDev installations before installing the new release.<br/>
<strong>Note 2</strong>: This release only works with Eclipse 3.1 (and from now on, Eclipse 3.0.x is no longer supported).
