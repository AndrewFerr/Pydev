<H3>This are the features I would like to have... (One can wish 
	right?)</H3>

<P>The roadmap is still not traced... but if you want to come along and do any of 
	those (or others), feel free... (features already implemented are not here 
	again).</P>

<LI>Make a nicer code completion - not executing code and with a better cache 
	system (first step is already done, now we have builders... next thing is
	figuring out some really nice cache system, and using the python
	nature for getting paths)
</LI>
<LI>Make the content assistant better</LI>
<LI>Quick outline (like java does)</LI>
<LI>Package explorer</LI>
<LI>Interactive shell</LI>
<LI>Wizards (create class / module)</LI>

<H3>You'd like to give it a try?</H3>

<P>You can download the latest source 
		from sourceforge. </P>

<P>To compile, you need to set the following preferences:</P>

<P>'Plug-In Development: Java Build Path Control: Use classpath containers' to true</P>

<P>'Plug-In Development: Target Platform' select "this application" and enable all plugins.</P>

<P>Most of the code is well-documented in javadoc. I try 
	to cc every answer to a codingquestion to pydev-code, so you can look there for 
	hints too. That's it. If you have not developed Eclipse plugins before, I 
	recommend reading the online documentation and trying out a sample plugin. 
	Doing some prep work before jumping in will really pay off.</P>

<P><STRONG>Then, it is all up to you.</STRONG></P>
