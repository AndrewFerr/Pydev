<H3>This&nbsp;are the features&nbsp;I would&nbsp;like to have... (One can wish 
	right?)</H3>
<P>The roadmap is still not traced... but if you want to come along and do any of 
	those (or others), feel free... (features already implemented are not here 
	again).</P>

<P><STRONG></STRONG><FONT face="Times New Roman">You can download the latest source 
		from sourceforge. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman">To compile, you need to setthe following preferences:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman">'Plug-In Development:Java Build Path Control:Use 
		classpath containers' to true</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman">'Plug-In Development:Target Platform' select "this 
		application" and enable all plugins.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman">Most of the code is well-documented in javadoc. I try 
		to cc every answer to a codingquestion to pydev-code, so you can look there for 
		hints too. That's it. If you have not developed Eclipse plugins before, I 
		recommend reading the online documentation and trying out a sample plugin. 
		Doing some prep work before jumping in will really pay off.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman"><STRONG>Then, it is all up to you.</STRONG></FONT><STRONG>
