To activate python 2.4 support in PyDev, you should right click on you project root, choose properties, go for
the Pydev details and choose version 2.4.<br>

<strong>NOTE: </strong>
Pydev now has some support for the new python syntax (version 2.4 - not really full support, but
it should do until the jython grammar used is updated - it also depends on the python asdl module - 
an attempt to unify both grammars...)
<br>
<br>
<strong>HOW IT WORKS: </strong>
Basically, it changes lines that have a syntax error on '@' to a 'pass' and reanalyzes the file. - I know this is really, 
but REALLY far from perfect, but it should do for those that are eager to use python 2.4 decorators new syntax and still have no support.
<br>
<br>
I would like to put some color support for that too (decorators), but this is going to depend on the grammar support...
