<H3>Code Completion</H3>

<br>
<strong> Notes for release 0.7.1 </strong>
<br><br>(<b>Code completion disabled by default </b>- see notes on the preferences page):<br>
Code completion has some changes in version 0.7.1, most notable, the parameters of a method are also gotten
when completing and the autocompletion has been completely disabled (mainly because of complaints on the editor 
hanging and because most of the time you don't have valid completions - it only works for the tokens gotten
from the global scope and on self - so, forget about trying to complete on parameters...). 
<br>

<P>But even with those limitations, this feature is already usable, but still has to be used with care, 
	as it <STRONG>executes the current editor code to get it's completions</STRONG>. That means that 
	one should be very careful on what is put in the global context when using code 
	completion.</P>

<P>So, that means that if you put sys.exec("rm -r *") in the&nbsp; top level of any 
	module, it would probably would really delete all you&nbsp;have... Not good 
	hummm... But if you did it, you would never be able&nbsp; to import that module 
	from python from anywhere, because it would do&nbsp;the same thing...(so, that 
	makes me feel not so guilty :-) ).

<strong> Now, how to use it:</strong><br>
<a href="codecompletionsnapshots.html">(Here are some snapshots on the current uses)</a>
<P>Code completion works on imports, on the current class and on 
	the global context - it uses the current pythonpath in order to do that, so, if 
	you go in python and</P>
<P><FONT face="Courier New" size="2">import sys<BR>
		print sys.path - those are the locations searched to get the imports tips.<BR>
	</FONT>Directories if they contain an __init__.py<BR>
	Files: .py, .py, .pyo, .pyd, .dll<BR>
	<BR>
	<STRONG>So, if you go: (| Marks Ctrl+Space)<BR>
	</STRONG><FONT face="Courier New" size="2">import | a list of the imports that can 
		be gotten should appear.<BR>
		import comp| completes imports that start with comp<BR>
		import compiler.| completes with compiler sub-modules and classes<BR>
		import compiler.ast.| completes with compiler.ast sub-modules and classes<BR>
		from compiler import | completes with compiler sub-modules and classes<BR>
		from compiler import ast.| completes with compiler.ast sub-modules and classes</FONT>
	<BR>
	<BR>
	Now for other completions:<BR>
	<BR>
	<STRONG>If you have a file<BR>
	</STRONG>
	<BR>
	<FONT face="Courier New" size="2">from compiler import *</FONT>
	<BR>
	<BR>
	And just Ctrl+Space, it should appear all the globals, in this case all 
	compiler submodules and classes.<BR>
	<BR>
	<STRONG>If you had just
		<BR>
	</STRONG>
	<BR>
	<FONT face="Courier New" size="2">Import compiler
		<BR>
	</FONT>
	<BR>
	Ctrl+Space would bring you '__builtins__' and 'compiler' suggestions<BR>
	<BR>
	<BR>
	<STRONG>For class code completion:<BR>
	</STRONG>
	<BR>
	<FONT face="Courier New" size="2">import compiler<BR>
	</FONT><FONT face="Courier New" size="2">class C(compiler.visitor.ASTVisitor):<BR>
		....def __init__(self):<BR>
		........self.| would bring you all the code available from this class.<BR>
		<BR>
		<BR>
		compiler.| would bring all that is contained within the compiler module<BR>
	</FONT>

<P><FONT><STRONG>Note on code completion:</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Courier New" size="2"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size="3">Currently code 
			completion does not work on methods after '(' and on any variable that is 
			passed in as a parameter. Right now it works only on 'self', on the imports
